In terms of reasonable chastisement, there was a spectrum of offending. The first stage was whether there was sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. If there was not enough evidence, the police did not go on to consider whether it was in the public interest, and the second stage was when the evidential stage was satisfied.", "relevant_text": "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. Barry Hughes: We have a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, does provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. In respect of children in particular, you'll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. That is a defence that is available for assault upon a child. By way of contrast, it is not available for an offence involving an adult. In that regard, it could be argued that children have fewer rights than adults. Sian Gwenllian AM: Well, a review was undertaken by the Government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form\u2014that that would be the best thing to do because there's no evidence that it's not working satisfactorily. You are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that's happened since 2007. Barry Hughes: I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that. We don't need to go back a very long way to find, for example, that there was no such offence as raping one's married wife, and the law has changed to reflect the fact that that is simply not acceptable. And from what I've seen of the research, and I think back to the 2007 review, to which you've just referred, there is evidence within that review already that opinions are changing. And I've seen research more current than that that suggests that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastising a child than do people of an older generation. Of course, as we move forward in time, the people who are young now are going to be the older adults of the future. So one would hope that the law will change to reflect the way in which people behave within society. Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you. We have heard evidence as a committee that this proposed law would provide a much clearer legal framework\u2014that is, to take out this reasonable punishment defence, that then would make things much clearer for parents and professionals. Does the CPS have a view on that? Barry Hughes: I think it will make things clearer. I'm not sure it will make them much clearer, because if we get into some of the\u2014. It may be helpful to look at some examples at some stage. And when it comes to prosecuting, it's often the case that things aren't just black and white; there are multiple shades of grey in between. We know that the Children Act did introduce a degree of clarity, in that it removed the defence of reasonable chastisement for offences of causing actual bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and various incidents of child cruelty under the Children and Young Persons Act. In that sense, matters were clarified, because up until that point it was not entirely clear. There were a series of Court of Appeal cases that sought to clarify the law, but that was at a time, at the end of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, when we had the European convention on human rights and we had a quickly developing body of case law. And the Children Act was brought in to reflect the direction that the case law was moving in. A decision was clearly made back then in the early 2000s not to include common assault in the same category as actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm et cetera. So, there was a decision made back then that it was appropriate to do that. As we wind forward some 15 years, I have seen the research that suggests that some people see that the present legislation, and the way in which section 58 applies to reasonable chastisement for common assault of children\u2014some people have interpreted that as saying that smacking is acceptable. I don't think that it is what it says, but there is a degree of confusion around that. And the reason why I say it's not as simple as that is, going back to my words a couple of minutes ago, it's rarely a case of being black and white; there are these degrees of grey. And removing that defence does make life clearer. Sian Gwenllian AM: What are the areas of grey that you refer to? Can you give a few examples? Barry Hughes: If you take an example\u2014so, one of the examples that I've heard discussed has been a child\u2014a young child; let's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road\u2014who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic. The parent grabs hold of the child and pulls them back. Now, technically, taking hold of the child at that point is an assault, because it's an unwanted imposition of physical force. But no-one's going to say that's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts. Of course, that would be utter nonsense. There's no hostility; it's simply taking hold of a child to protect them. At that point, the parent then seeks to admonish the child, tells them off and smacks the child on the legs. Now, that would probably be seen under the present law as reasonable chastisement. Probably. But so much depends upon the circumstances, whether this is something that happens frequently with the child, the size of the child, the parent, the force of the slap, the way in which it's imposed. So, that, I would say, sits at one end of the spectrum. As we move towards the other end of the spectrum, we might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. So, there is a spectrum of offending. Towards one end of the spectrum we move much closer towards something that would be criminal in nature. There'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police, and the police would take some form of action, and then, as we move through the tiers, it'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. We would then decide the most appropriate means of dealing with it. And the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court. That would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that I've just described to you. Does that help to illustrate that, at one end, it's relatively white and the other end it's relatively black, but in the middle we have the shades of grey? Sian Gwenllian AM: But that would mean that there could be more prosecutions at the softer end. Because if you're removing this\u2014we'll probably come on to that. Barry Hughes: Shall I address that in terms\u2014? Okay. So, you are probably aware, but forgive me if I just explain quickly anyway, when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is\u2014. And you only get to the second stage if the first stage is satisfied. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, we only get on to the public interest stage once the evidential stage is satisfied. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. It's a matter for them whether they refer a matter to the Crown Prosecution Service. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case\u2014the light smacking on the leg\u2014at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think\u2014and I think this is what will probably happen in practice\u2014that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. It may be that the police decide that it is\u2014it may have been two smacks, three smacks, so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious. So, it may be referred to the CPS for a charging decision. We would then apply independently the same test, and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists, which takes us on to considering the public interest. In the circumstances that I've described, every case is going to be unique on its own facts, but in the circumstances that I've described, if it is just a light smack and it's a one-off and there's no history of this, it would probably be the sort of offence we'd decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute."}

Sian Gwenllian AM: But isn't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that? Do you know what I'm saying? Barry Hughes: If this Bill goes through, then it will remove a defence, which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the CPS than beforehand, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will refer it, because it will depend on the facts of each individual case. Sian Gwenllian AM: Thanks. Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in England and Wales from Dawn Bowden. Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Hello. The Assembly doesn't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the CPS, as you know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that? Barry Hughes: Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this\u2014and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing\u2014that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. And so, there are issues there in terms of the awareness of members of the public. The second example that I'll give you is that we already have within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example I'll give to you is this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 \u00b5g in 100 ml of breath. Across the border in Scotland, it drops to 22 \u00b5g. So, the same act\u2014. As you drive into Scotland, you're probably okay to drive if you've got 34 \u00b5g; by the time you get into Scotland, you won't be. And the consequences for you are significant, because of course it's an offence in Scotland, and not an offence in England, but the punishment, namely disqualification, applies everywhere in the United Kingdom. So, we already have a degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognises this. In our code, we have a specific provision that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law. We will issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise. And we think that we are sufficiently flexible to take account of that. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that? Barry Hughes: Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. There will be a further series of awareness raising. We have strategic implementation groups\u2014Iwan sits on that group. So, we would build ourselves up to come up with the appropriate guidance according to the circumstances. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, we would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences\u2014and we might want to get into the number of potential offences, but my take on it is the number of offences is likely to be very small and we would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that comes through goes to people who've got a close network and can talk with each other\u2014 Dawn Bowden AM: And that would be primarily around the public interest issue. Barry Hughes: It would."}

Dawn Bowden AM: I understand. Okay. So you're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications. What's actually been your involvement with the Government as they've been developing this legislation? Barry Hughes: My own personal involvement? Dawn Bowden AM: Or the service's. Barry Hughes: Iwan and colleagues have had some involvement on a more routine basis. I met with a Minister and a Deputy Minister\u2014I met with Huw Irranca-Davies a little while ago, and I met with Julie Morgan a few months ago\u2014to discuss the overall implications, and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other. It hasn't been a very close-knit involvement, but we have had enough involvement so that we've felt we've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. So you've been satisfied with the level of involvement that you've had. Barry Hughes: Yes. I don't feel that it's been too much, nor do I feel we've been left on the side at all. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Now, we've just talked about the divergence of criminal law, and this is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance. Barry Hughes: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that. Dawn Bowden AM: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales\u2014well, and in England, actually, across the border\u2014will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law?

[Laughter.] Dawn Bowden AM: But you would expect that to be something you would\u2014 Barry Hughes: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. So, actually, I'm probably being unfair to myself. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes? Barry Hughes: They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. We have regular interchange of prosecutors between England and Wales. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law. Dawn Bowden AM: That's helpful, thank you. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation. Barry Hughes: In addition to those that I've mentioned, probably not. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. That's fine. Thank you, Chair. Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. I was going to ask this question later, but I think it fits in\u2014. I've forgotten what I was going to ask; this is terrible. Oh no, that's right\u2014obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers\u00a0of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision? Barry Hughes: I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. I've had some discussions with Kwame, who would have an involvement in this. What we would envisage is that we would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which are set out, in my view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and we would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that we're discussing here. So, it would be taking principles of generality and according them a degree of specificity. And we'd need to work that up as we go along, and I think you'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse, if I may put it like that. Suzy Davies AM: It's just that, personally, I think the public interest test is critical in all this, and it would really help us to understand what it could look like before we commit to a particular course of action in supporting or not supporting the Bill, that was all.

Sian Gwenllian AM: My point is about the criminal law in Wales and England diverging in this particular instance, and we've been told that this is probably the first time it's happened. Can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion? Barry Hughes: There are other offences in Wales that don't exist in England, but they don't crop up very often. So, to give you examples, there is an offence of putting an electronic collar on your pet\u2014let's not stretch that into children. [Laughter.] But, you know, sometimes\u2014I'll be quiet. But putting an electronic collar on your pet that administers a shock is an offence in Wales; it's not an offence in England. There are also offences around the picking of cockles in west Wales, which is not an offence\u2014. So, you can see there are some, but I would argue that the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England is possibly more significant for the general public. Of course, the topic we're discussing here is of real relevance for the general public, and you have heard evidence, I know, already, that comes from people who are quite strongly in favour and people quite strongly against it. One of the ways in which I've approached this is looking at it from the perspective of what the law is there for, which is to set out, in essence, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to use the law for that, but it signifies how society views a certain behaviour. I like to look at it from the perspective of the person who is being affected by this, namely the child, and the change in the law here would afford children a degree of protection that they don't presently have, but which they do have when they attain the age of 16.FootnoteLink So, I looked at this\u2014. If I can give you another example. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. Sometimes they admonish them verbally and then that turns into physical admonishment. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying\u2014but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. That seems to me to not necessarily fit with where we ought to be as a society. Sian Gwenllian AM: Do you think that what we're doing in Wales will be emulated in England at some point? Barry Hughes: Well, it's certainly going through in parallel in Scotland, and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this, including a large number of European countries. Who knows? Trying to get any legislation through Westminster at the moment\u2014who knows? Not tomorrow, I'd say. Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some specific questions around implementation now from Suzy Davies. Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. Can I just begin by asking you to help the committee out here in understanding how the burden of proof is going to work if this defence is removed? Because the issue of whether something is punishment or not is going to disappear, providing that it's clear that contact with a child has happened. Is that going to work on the presumption that that's an unlawful contact? Is that something the prosecution will still have to prove, or will it be for an accused parent to say, to use your example, 'I was just dragging them out of the traffic or stopping them putting their hands in the fire'? Barry Hughes: I understand your point. There's no change whatsoever to the burden of proof, nor to the standard of proof. Suzy Davies AM: Perhaps you can run us through it quickly. Barry Hughes: If the defence argue that that act was\u2014. So, we have to show that there's been an unlawful assault. So, if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement, in a sense that alters some things but it doesn't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution, which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And if the defence raise an argument and say, 'Well, look, that was a lawful act; I was only doing what I thought was reasonable in the circumstances', it's for the Crown to disprove that."}

Suzy Davies AM: Okay. That's really helpful for us to understand that. Obviously, when we're talking about CPS guidelines and all the rest, we've already come some distance down the process, haven't we? Have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest? Because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you're arrested, that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like DBS checks in the future, even if it goes no further. Do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on, even at the point of the knock at the door? Barry Hughes: From the perspective of the CPS, I'm not sure I can help you there. Suzy Davies AM: That's fine. I was expecting that answer. Barry Hughes: Simply because that's a matter for the police. Unlike in many other jurisdictions, we have no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decide not to investigate\u2014. I routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something, and they want us to do something about it and we can't. We can't direct the police. Suzy Davies AM: Thank you for that, because I thought that was important to get on the record as well. We're looking at a period of a couple of years after this Act passes\u2014if it does\u2014for implementation. Is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law? Barry Hughes: I think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we've built up with the Welsh Government and colleagues there. I think we need to keep abreast of things as they move forward. We need involvement\u2014Iwan, for example, and the strategic implementation group. We have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and I believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected; that we can liaise, in turn, with Kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop. So, I think we've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose\u2014at least, 'adequate' might sound a little\u2014 Suzy Davies AM: Sufficient. Barry Hughes: Yes, perfectly sufficient."}

Barry Hughes answered that there would be minor financial consequences for the public prosecution service in the period between now and the bill becoming law, but there would not be any significant financial consequences in that time. The reason was that they would keep a manual log of every referral, which would be unmanageable if they were dealing with hundreds and hundreds of cases. Moreover, the numbers would be very small, which meant they would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, they would wish to keep the situation under review, and they would look back to see how they were doing.", "relevant_text": "Barry Hughes: Yes, perfectly sufficient. Suzy Davies AM: So, you're confident, by 2022, then, that you'll have changes to the CPS guidelines that are good to go, if you like. Barry Hughes: Fit for purpose, yes. Suzy Davies AM: Yes. Okay, that's great. Bear with me a second\u2014thank you very much\u2014in your written evidence, you did welcome the indication from the Welsh Government that this reasonable period after Royal Assent would be necessary. Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this? Barry Hughes: If this legislation goes through, there will be minor financial consequences for us and I don't see any significant financial consequences in the period between now and the Bill becoming law other than the time of ourselves in discussing this today. But there isn't anything significant. There's nothing that will impact upon our performance as the public prosecution service in that time. Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this. Barry Hughes: Certainly. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will\u2014. Normally, we do this through our case management system, which is England-and-Wales wide, and you'd put a flag on. So, for example, domestic abuse, there's a flag for that, and assault on a child, there's a flag for that. But this would be a very specific flag for assault on a child\u2014reasonable chastisement. Trying to get that through on a system that covers all of England and Wales\u2014it's quite expensive, unbelievably; it wouldn't happen. So, we would keep a manual log of every referral. That would be unmanageable if we were dealing with hundreds and hundreds of cases. Suzy Davies AM: So, you're not anticipating hundreds and hundreds. Barry Hughes: Not at all. Not at all. My take on it: I've seen and spoken with Matt Jukes about this, from South Wales Police; I have seen the justice impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. If that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. So, you're talking small numbers. Now, small numbers\u2014and we might not have any. Okay? It depends. Obviously, if there's a really good awareness-raising campaign, you make it less likely. And, for us, prosecution\u2014it's not the first port of call here at all. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever\u201412, 18 months, maybe 24 months\u2014where we'd look back to see how we are doing. And I'd like to think that we will be doing that in consultation with interested parties and stakeholders. We do this already with certain types of offences. We have what we call local scrutiny involvement panels. So, for offences such as racially aggravated offending, whether it's criminal damage or offence against the person, we will bring together interested parties, by which I mean people from outside the CPS, quite often third sector agencies that represent vulnerable groups. We'd bring them in and look through the cases. So, we open our books, show them our cases, and we have a very frank discussion. We involve the police in that as well. That, in turn, helps us shape and improve the way that we prosecute these cases and I can foresee that, after this legislation came in, we might get 18 months, two years down the road, and I can see us sitting in a room with some of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how we're doing with it all. And I'd like to think that the Welsh Government would be involved in that as well. Suzy Davies AM: That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. It's nobody's fault; that's just how it is. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example\u2014the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question. Barry Hughes: I can attempt an answer. I follow entirely where you're going. I agree, the chances are pretty low, but they're greater than they are presently. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children."}

Suzy Davies AM: Okay, that's really helpful, thank you. Lynne Neagle AM: Before we move on, can I just ask\u2014? The Children Act 2004 applies to a child up to the age of 18\u2014 Barry Hughes: Sixteen. Lynne Neagle AM: You mentioned 16; that's what I wanted to clarify. Our understanding was that it went up to 18. Barry Hughes: I'm reasonably confident that it's 16.FootnoteLink Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now specifically on prosecutions and potential alternatives from Vikki Howells. Vikki Howells AM: Thank you, Chair. You've already touched quite a bit on the issue of the public interest test. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill? Barry Hughes: Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. Now, there comes a point in time when the defence stops applying. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. Some of them are fairly obvious, such as previous convictions. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. But there's no part of the law that says that prosecution will always follow. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted. Vikki Howells AM: Thank you, that's really useful, and\u2014 Lynne Neagle AM: Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Now, I've looked at the code and there is a section about impact on the victim. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution?"}

In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. It may be that there are\u2014. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. It's not determinative but it is a factor that we take into account. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy, you've got a supplementary on that. Suzy Davies AM: Yes. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed. Barry Hughes: That's a really interesting question. There is a body of law that\u2014 Suzy Davies AM: A child can't consent to assault. Barry Hughes: Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. The law is really quite difficult. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. That went too far as well. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. So, the law has considered that in some depth. I'm still not entirely clear, and I speak as a lawyer. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to. Suzy Davies AM: Yes, because we're talking below a certain standard here as well. Okay. Barry Hughes: As to what you can consent to, it's less clear. It would need to be developed. Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you for that. Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Vikki. Vikki Howells AM: Thank you. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option?"}

There would also be cases, and they saw these not that rarely, where the police would bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and the CPS would take a different view on the Public interest stage. Therefore, if a person from England was being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that applied in Wales. However, the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it was that the Act, if passed, would achieve its intentions.", "relevant_text": "Barry Hughes: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. Their lead is deputy chief constable Sara Glen. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. Any case that the police refer to us for a charging decision is going to be something\u2014. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say\u2014for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth\u2014we\u00a0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering\u00a0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility\u2014that will fall to the police\u2014but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. Does that help? Vikki Howells AM: It does. One final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this Bill\u2014how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited? Barry Hughes: The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved\u2014the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction. Vikki Howells AM: And who would build that infrastructure, in your opinion? Barry Hughes: Somewhere within Wales\u2014Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. It may be that the police and crime commissioners use some of their commissioning powers to work something up. I'm not the right person to answer that question. Vikki Howells AM: Okay. Thank you, Chair. Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. There's no such duty proposed in this Bill. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales? Barry Hughes: I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example? Barry Hughes: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here\u2014by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes\u2014if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on the unintended consequences from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}

The number of cases would be tiny, and dwarfed by the many cases where they had to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. And, in his experience, the police were much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target.", "relevant_text": "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence. Barry Hughes: Yes. Okay. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. It may be\u2014the sort of circumstance I can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'Prosecute me'. We probably would end up prosecuting, because it's a relatively serious offence. So, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in England\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. But I think, along the road there, there would have been an element of choice. Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And do you think that that would be an isolated incident? Barry Hughes: Yes, truly, I believe, an isolated incident. I've said before that I would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. They're likely to be very limited. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest. Sian Gwenllian AM: Thank you for that. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures? Barry Hughes: I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. In the CPS, we don't have targets for securing convictions or not. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets\u2014it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean. Sian Gwenllian AM: What about\u2014? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence? Barry Hughes: I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. That disappeared some years ago. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. The police are required to report against this, but we don't have targets. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. It's much less of an issue than it ever was\u2014much. Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. This happens now, of course. Is that going to increase if we change the law? Barry Hughes: There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Regrettably, there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. I can see it potentially arising. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication. Sian Gwenllian AM: Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law?"}

The criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand.", "relevant_text": "Barry Hughes: No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. And I can't think of anything else off the top of my head. Sian Gwenllian AM: Finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point. Barry Hughes: Right. How to approach that one? In the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the Government, the then Government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the European convention. There are various parties who would disagree with that, but that was the then Government's position. If Wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, Wales would be more in compliance with ECHR than not, and England would be less so. But nonetheless, at present, I haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case I referred to, Regina v H, which was heard back in 2001 in the Court of Appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. Sian Gwenllian AM: And that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the UK\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the European Union. Barry Hughes: It could, but I would be a foolish man if I were to say what impact European jurisprudence might have upon us. [Laughter.] Suzy Davies AM: [Inaudible.]\u2014like common law jurisdictions would be. Barry Hughes: Yes. At this point in time, that'd be a bit of a punt. Lynne Neagle AM: Yes. Okay. Thank you. Janet. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the Bill will be of great significance to the Crown Prosecution Service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. So, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. What's your answer to that? Barry Hughes: There is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and I think probably about\u2014. There are over\u2014. From memory\u2014please never hold me to this\u2014but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. There are some offences on the statute\u2014. I've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. So, we have various defences to do with Acts. I remember seeing some about Antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there. Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant\u2014what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything\u2014that would be a nonsense\u2014or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. The criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. So, awareness is important and it comes back to that point. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. And then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise?"}

Then, they discussed the working design of the buttons and how to make that the best function for the user. The group decided to use a battery for the energy source, a button pad for input, a pre-made chip which would handle all the processing stuff, an I-R transmitter to communicate to the TV and a location function on the remote itself.", "relevant_text": "Marketing: Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue . Project Manager: Hm . Marketing: Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than  you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together .  And that's all I have to say about the matter ,  um . Project Manager: 'Kay . Marketing: Shall I  what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ? Project Manager: Yeah . Just move right on . User Interface: Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ? Project Manager: Uh function F_ eight . Marketing: Function F_ eight . User Interface: 'Kay . What's function ? Project Manager: It's the little blue  w it's the one  th User Interface: Oh function , I see it . Project Manager: yeah . Yeah should be User Interface: There we go . Project Manager: It should be  yeah . User Interface: Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um  just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet  . User Interface: And okay so basically um  I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um  so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that  like close together that um  are used in the same way , uh  or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh  can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the TV . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um  does it do  or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um   I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but  And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .  Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um  like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .  That concludes my presentation . User Interface: Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh . Industrial Designer: How do I um Marketing: S That's on view . Industrial Designer: Right . Marketing: Oh . Industrial Designer: Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the TV . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the TV and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the TV , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their TV or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the TV . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the TV which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the TV , that's just sort of standard , um so most TVs have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation . Project Manager: 'Kay . User Interface: Do you know about like Industrial Designer: Mm ? User Interface: I dunno , you seem like you know about Industrial Designer: Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here . User Interface: Okay . Cool . Project Manager: Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um  we have  we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so   due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um , Project Manager: also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something  I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah .  Do  Let's Project Manager: I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can User Interface: Like in terms of Marketing: How it looks or User Interface: how it looks , or like what it does ? Project Manager: wha what  um  well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So . User Interface: Yeah . Okay . So  Is our target group then people  so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? Project Manager: I think that seems to  yeah . Mm . User Interface: So Industrial Designer: It's easy to implement . User Interface: Okay . So the Marketing: the the buzzer you mean , User Interface: yeah , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer: Locator . Marketing: yeah , for sure , yeah . User Interface: So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , Project Manager: Yeah , teenagers and young professionals . User Interface: what was it ? Marketing: Well that's for speech recognition . Project Manager: Oh , uh . Industrial Designer: Well User Interface: Oh . Marketing: And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen . Industrial Designer: I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: and also , if the TV is on it's making sound and the people on the TV are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the TV's gonna switch itself to channel one , Marketing: Yeah yeah yeah . Project Manager: Mm . Industrial Designer: or  it seems like a silly , User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: I mean Industrial Designer: I'm not sure how you would implement it . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: I just put the values  in . Project Manager: And if if you consider our budget , it probably Marketing: But um the screen is the same as what , Industrial Designer: It's a cool idea but Project Manager: if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Yeah , I'm happy with that . Project Manager: Yeah  . Project Manager: Right so um  yeah . User Interface: Hu yeah . Marketing: Completely . User Interface: Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a  like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the TV itself . Industrial Designer: Well you would have to have a button on a TV or on your wall or some place  since the TV already has power . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the TV it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . User Interface: Okay . Okay . Marketing: Yeah ."}

Industrial Designer: Well you would have to have a button on a TV or on your wall or some place  since the TV already has power . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the TV it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . User Interface: Okay . Okay . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . User Interface: Alright . Marketing: Okay . User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can Industrial Designer: It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote  . Project Manager: right . Yeah , yeah . Marketing: So do you plug it in the T_  you plug it in TV , this thing ? Industrial Designer: Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your TV so if you need to find the remote , click the button . Marketing: Okay . Okay . User Interface: So it's now like a two-part thing . Industrial Designer: Yeah , so it would be a two part package . User Interface: Okay . Alright . Marketing: Okay . User Interface: So we get to design that too . User Interface: Make it fashionable . Um , okay . Project Manager: So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . Industrial Designer: Yeah I think so . Marketing: Yeah . Just there . Project Manager: Huh . Okay . Marketing: Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the  thing to put the  you s you talking about a home for it . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? Project Manager: We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's Marketing: Okay . User Interface: Yeah . Then it can live anywhere . Project Manager: Yeah  . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Okay . For the  so you have that button , that  so there's  is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? Industrial Designer: Um on the TV or on the phone ? Marketing: Are we just having a radio ? On the phone . Industrial Designer: Um it seemed like a  a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , User Interface: T Marketing: You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: I think that's what the phone has , Marketing: Yeah yeah . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it  and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . Project Manager: And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so Marketing: You can hear it's under the couch yeah . Project Manager: yeah . User Interface: So i Yeah . Marketing: Um ,   So need the other buttons . So we have this  mm . Project Manager: So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them  , yeah you you did um , User Interface: That was that was me . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: they're  I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . User Interface: I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . Project Manager: Oh really . 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities . User Interface: And uh Industrial Designer: Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across  international ? User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: They're not  no . Marketing: They're not , no . Industrial Designer: Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s . User Interface: S Project Manager: Yeah , that's right , yeah . Marketing: It not V_H_S_ here ? Project Manager: But D_V_D_ probably is . Industrial Designer: Yeah , other than that region and coding thing . User Interface: Um Project Manager: And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days . Marketing: But V_C_R_s  Yeah . Yeah , for sure . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . User Interface: Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can  I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take  like just reduce the number of buttons you know , Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the TV . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Well for sure we need the um  I think we can just design the channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , Project Manager: S User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Huh . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: s and it's usually that red User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: You know , I've seen some remotes that  where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on .

Just 'cause I wouldn't  I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . Project Manager: Yeah . Besides you like to be able to go power .

So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Well even um iPod thing   , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of User Interface: That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . Marketing: scrolling  I don't know . Project Manager: Mm . Marketing: Yeah . Because people li seem  now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no  Know you don't have one two three four five User Interface: Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , Project Manager: Mm . User Interface: it's it's funny like you f like I just  I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and  it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Yeah yeah , it's just  and it's one thing which has everything . User Interface: Yeah , and it is  yeah . It is really  but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? Marketing: Well can't it tell the  like can't you  if you Industrial Designer: Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . User Interface: Yeah . Okay . Marketing: you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . Project Manager: Oh that's gonna  Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of User Interface: Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like  it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . Project Manager: okay . I've never used one . No . Marketing: It's like l this  like that , and then you do that . Project Manager: Okay . Okay . User Interface: Yeah . Yeah and then . Marketing: And then you can have um   if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing  like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . User Interface: Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that  Or it  oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can Marketing: Yeah , you can Project Manager: Well i User Interface: zap . Marketing: Yeah , click o actually click on to have User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . Marketing: Yeah . User Interface: Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom  So do you need to Industrial Designer: Doesn't it rotate though , User Interface: okay . Industrial Designer: so it'll be moving around . User Interface: Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like Marketing: What do you mean the function ? User Interface: I mean like okay , 'cause so  I dunno , I guess  Okay  so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . User Interface: But then Marketing: Yeah . User Interface: so if you wanna switch to the  to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down . Marketing: Yeah but it knows for some reason . User Interface: It just Marketing: The iPod knows . User Interface: It just kno  the iPod knows .  S Industrial Designer: If it works on an iPod then it works . Project Manager: Huh . User Interface: Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . Industrial Designer: I don't have one . Marketing: Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . User Interface: Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . Industrial Designer: Oh . Project Manager: So it's like holding Marketing: And then  well if you do that it goes , but if you  like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen . Project Manager: You can  o And you you  is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually  you're just using the mouse to go up and down . Marketing: Well what you Project Manager: Like User Interface: It's like a b Marketing: for the iPod you press an  w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm . Marketing: But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure Project Manager: Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ?

Marketing: and that's another thing they complained about . Project Manager: Mm . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Um , what other buttons were there ? Volume  oh we've ts just said that . User Interface: So okay . Marketing: Channel selection . User Interface: This is just for TV , it's not for  or it is  does need to be compatible with Project Manager: Um Industrial Designer: I  A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . User Interface: So how do you switch Marketing: Menu . Industrial Designer: and menu maybe . Oh yeah . Project Manager: So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next User Interface: Okay . So like if we had that Project Manager: But we'll hold off on that 'cause User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: But s yeah uh . Marketing: But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote . User Interface: That's true , yeah . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: So , I know I'm not c really clear on what Industrial Designer: But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . User Interface: Yeah , yeah . Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Project Manager: Mm . Mm . User Interface: So you'd have to have like Marketing: Yeah . User Interface: I think  you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can  you're either on TV , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons . User Interface: Yeah , Marketing: Yeah , it is only fun User Interface: but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . Project Manager: But i Yeah . Industrial Designer: Oh . But I think the circle only does  channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna User Interface: Yeah but it  it would be Industrial Designer: but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the TV so you don't have to switch . User Interface: So  but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're  if you're on TV , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different  I mean do we need to think about that , Project Manager: Um , yeah , let's think about it User Interface: that like Industrial Designer: Yes we can try that .

Everybody goes around and reads the digits on the  the bottom of their forms . Professor C: Session R PhD D: R - nineteen ? PhD A: OK . Professor C: R - nineteen . PhD F: Yeah . We 're  This is session R - nineteen . Professor C: If you say so . O K . Do we have anything like an agenda ? What 's going on ? Um . I guess um . So . One thing PhD F: Sunil 's here for the summer ? Professor C: Sunil 's here for the summer , right . Um , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh , and then just uh , I guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . Um . PhD F: I could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . Professor C: Mm - hmm . OK . Why don't you start with that ? That 's sort of PhD F: OK . Professor C: Yeah ? PhD F: We um  So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . And um , uh , we ordered uh , SUN - Blade - one - hundreds , and um , I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running  So the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um ,  run things using P - make and Customs . You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that . The simplest thing  And I can send an email around or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something . Um , Professor C: How about an email that points to the FAQ , PhD F: there 's a c Professor C: you know what I 'm saying ? PhD F: Yeah , yeah . Professor C: so that you can  Yeah . PhD F: Uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called \" run command \" . \" Run dash command \" , \" run hyphen command \" . And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh  and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . So you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command . So you can say \" run dash command L S \" , and , um , it 'll actually export that  LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , and um  And that 's a simple way to get started using  using this . And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up ,  um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it . Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . So . You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . So , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're  Uh . The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it . Professor C: So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , PhD F: So . Professor C: is the rough division of PhD F: Yeah . Exactly . Yeah , you know , I  I sort of got started  using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh I fired off a training job , and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , \" uh , are you running two  trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . \" So I had to back off a little bit . But , soon as we get some more machines then uh  then we 'll have more compute available . So , um , that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . So . Grad G: Um , I have  I have a question about the uh , parallelization ? PhD F: Mm - hmm . Grad G: So , um , let 's say I have like , a thousand little  little jobs to do ? PhD F: Mm - hmm . Grad G: Um , how do I do it with \" run command \" ? I mean do PhD F: You could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job Grad G: Uh - huh . A thousand times ? PhD F: right ? But you probably wanna be careful with that Grad G: OK . PhD F: because um , you don't wanna saturate the network . Uh , so , um , you know , you should  you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people Grad G: Oh , too much file transfer and stuff . PhD F: Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with  if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . Um , Grad G: OK . PhD F: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . Um . So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \" , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time . And uh , then , when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one . Um , Professor C: I remember I  I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or  or Hopkins workshop , I remember one of the workshops I was at there were  everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out . PhD F: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor C: So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines PhD F: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor C: and  and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . PhD F: Yeah . Yep . Yeah , exactly . Yeah , you have to be a little bit careful . Professor C: as I recall , but . Yeah . PhD D: Hmm . PhD F: Um , but uh , you can also  If you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in  in a Perl script to take care of that , you can use um , P - make Grad G: Just do P - make . PhD F: and  and you basically write a Make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things , Grad G: s Mm - hmm . PhD F: and when you run P - make , uh , on your Make file , you can give it the dash capital J and  and then a number , Grad G: Mm - hmm . PhD F: and that number represents how many uh , machines to use at once . And then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that . Grad G: Right . PhD F: So , Grad G: Right . OK . PhD F: I can get some documentation . PhD D: So it  it 's  it 's not systematically queued . I mean all the jobs are running . If you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . Alright . PhD F: It depends . If you  \" Run command \" , that I mentioned before , is  doesn't know about other things that you might be running . PhD D: Uh - huh . PhD F: So , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once , PhD D: Right . PhD F: and they wouldn't know about each other . But if you use P - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run PhD D: Mm - hmm . PhD F: and it can control , uh , how many it runs simultaneously . Professor C: So \" run command \" doesn't use P - make , or  ? PhD F: It uses \" export \" underlyingly . But , if you  i It 's meant to be run one job at a time ? So you could fire off a thousand of those , and it doesn't know  any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running . Professor C: So why would one use that rather than P - make ? PhD F: Well , if you have , um  Like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a P - make script and you just had a , uh  an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , you can say \" run command \" and your HTK thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and  and run your job there . Professor C: Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it PhD F: Yes . Yeah , there are um  Right . So some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called \" no evict \" . And if you specify that , in  in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from . Professor C: Mm - hmm . PhD F: But , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and  and they were at lunch , Professor C: Mm - hmm . PhD F: they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted  your job  will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . Automatically . So  which can cause you to lose time , right ? If you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . So . If you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus  the attribute , you know , \" no evict \" , and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . So . Professor C: Um , what  what about  I remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you  if something required  if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? PhD F: Mm - hmm . Professor C: and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? PhD F: Yeah , I  I 'm not sure how that works . Professor C: Yeah . PhD F: Uh , it seems like Andreas did something for that . Professor C: Hmm . PhD F: Um . Professor C: OK . We can ask him sometime ."}

Well , why don't we uh , uh , Sunil since you 're  haven't  haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's  what 's up with you ? Wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully . PhD A: Um . Yeah . So , uh , shall I start from  Well I don't know how may I  how  OK . Uh , I think I 'll start from the post uh Aurora submission maybe . Professor C: Yeah . PhD A: Uh , yeah , after the submission the  what I 've been working on mainly was to take  take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in  in ours . So  So I tried uh , And u First I tried just LDA . And then I found that uh , I mean , if  if I combine it with LDA , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . Uh PhD F: Are y are you saying LDA ? PhD A: Yeah . Yeah . PhD F: LDA . OK . PhD A: So , just  just the LDA filters . I just plug in  I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that . But the LDA filter that I used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . PhD F: Mm - hmm . PhD A: What I did was  I took the LDA filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow  narrow band LDA filter that we submitted uh , I got new filters . So that seems to be giving  uh , improving over their uh , system . Slightly . But , not very significantly . And uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over  final  by plugging in an LDA . And uh , so then after  after that I  I added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . And that  there  there also I n I found that I have to make some changes to their time constant that I used because th it has a  a mean and variance update time constant and  which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . But um , I didn't  I didn't play with that time constant a lot , I just t g I just found that I have to reduce the value  I mean , I have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . That 's all I found So I have to . Uh , Yeah . And uh , uh , the other  other thing what I tried was , I just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the Aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the  I mean the w speech and nonspeech . And uh , I found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . Professor C: Uh , can you back up a second , I  I  I missed something , uh , I guess my mind wandered . Ad - ad When you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? PhD A: Yeah . No . Professor C: or is it ? PhD A: No . No , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used . Professor C: Did it not ? No , no . With a different time constant . PhD A: With the different time constant I found that  I mean , I didn't get an improvement over not using on - line normalization , Professor C: Oh . PhD A: because I  I found that I would have change the value of the update factor . Professor C: No you didn't , OK . PhD A: But I didn't play it with play  play quite a bit to make it better than . Professor C: Yeah . PhD A: So , it 's still not Professor C: OK . PhD A: I mean , the on - line normalization didn't give me any improvement . Professor C: OK . PhD A: And uh , so , Professor C: OK . PhD A: oh yeah So I just stopped there with the uh , speech enhancement . The  the other thing what I tried was the  adding the uh , endpoint information to the baseline and that itself gives like twenty - two percent because the  the second  the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech . And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information , I just , uh , use Professor C: Hmm . PhD F: So people won't even have to worry about , uh , doing speech - nonspeech then . PhD A: Yeah that 's , that 's what the feeling is like . They 're going to give the endpoint information . PhD F: Mmm . Professor C: G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway , PhD F: I see . Professor C: everybody does that , PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: and they wanted to see , given that you 're doing that , what  what are the best features that you should use . PhD F: Yeah , I see . PhD A: So , Professor C: I mean clearly they 're interact . So I don't know that I entirely agree with it . PhD F: Yeah . Professor C: But  but it might be uh  In some ways it might be better t to  rather than giving the endpoints , to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with . PhD F: Mm - hmm . Professor C: But , you know . It 's  it 's still someth reasonable . PhD F: So , are people supposed to assume that there is uh  Are  are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints ? PhD A: Uh PhD F: Or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things ? PhD A: No . No . That i I  Yeah . Yeah , yeah , exactly . I guess that is  that is where the consensus is . Like y you will  you will  You 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech but the whole speech is available to you . PhD F: OK . PhD A: So . Professor C: So it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better , PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: because you don't have the mistakes in it . Yeah ? PhD A: Yeah . So Professor C: OK . PhD A: So that  that  The baseline itself  I mean , it improves by twenty - two percent . I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases , that like , the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint . w PhD F: Wow . PhD A: I mean you don't need any further speech enhancement with fifty . So , uh , PhD F: So the baseline itself improves by fifty percent . PhD A: Yeah , by fifty percent . Professor C: Yeah . PhD F: Wow . Professor C: So it 's g it 's gonna be harder to  beat that actually . PhD F: Yeah . PhD A: Yeah , so Professor C: But  but PhD A: so that is when uh , the  the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched . And I think they have  they have actually changed their qualification c criteria now . And uh , Yeah , I guess after that , I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks . Uh . Professor C: OK . No , that 's  that 's  that 's a good  good update . PhD A: Ye Yeah , and I  I came back and I started working on uh , some other speech enhancement algorithm . I mean , so  I  from the submission what I found that people have tried spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering . These are the main uh , approaches where people have tried , Professor C: Yeah . PhD A: so just to  just to fill the space with some f few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot , I  I 've been working on this uh , signal subspace approach for speech enhancement where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s and the noise subspace and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace . And Professor C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: So , I 've been actually running some s So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab . I have to  to  to test whether it works first or not Professor C: Yeah . PhD A: and then I 'll p port it to C and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result . So , yeah . Professor C: S So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second . So  so now you 're  you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: and  so we we 'll have a  single place where the stuff is . PhD A: Yep . Yeah ."}

Cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week , I guess ? PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor C: Um , where you were also combining something  both of you I guess were both combining something from the uh , French Telecom system with  the u uh PhD D: Right . Professor C: I  I don't know whether it was system one or system two , or  ? PhD D: Mm - hmm . It was system one . So Professor C: OK . PhD D: we  The main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the France Telecom , which provide us some speech samples that are uh , with noise removed . Professor C: So I let me  let me just stop you there . So then , one distinction is that uh , you were taking the actual France Telecom features and then applying something to PhD A: Uh , no there is a slight different . Uh I mean , which are extracted at the handset because they had another back - end blind equalization Professor C: Yeah . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: Yeah . But that 's what I mean . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: But u u Sorry , PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: yeah , I 'm not being  I 'm not being clear . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something , right ? PhD A: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Professor C: And so one difference is that , I guess you were taking spectra . PhD A: The speech . PhD B: Yeah . PhD D: Yeah . But I guess it 's the s exactly the same thing because on the heads uh , handset they just applied this Wiener filter and then compute cepstral features , PhD A: Yeah , the cepstral f The difference is like  There may be a slight difference in the way PhD D: right ? or  ? PhD A: because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech . I mean , if we are using our own code for th I mean that  that could be the only difference . PhD D: Right . PhD A: I mean , there is no other difference . PhD D: Mm - hmm . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: But you got some sort of different result . So I 'm trying to understand it . But uh , I th PhD D: Yeah , well I think we should uh , have a table with all the result because I don't know I uh , I don't exactly know what are your results ? But , PhD A: OK . OK . PhD D: Mmm . Yeah , but so we did this , and another difference I guess is that we just applied uh , proposal - one system after this without  well , with our modification to reduce the delay of the  the LDA filters , PhD A: Uh - huh . PhD D: and PhD B: And the filter PhD D: Well there are slight modifications , but it was the full proposal - one . In your case , if you tried just putting LDA , then maybe on - line normalization  ? PhD A: Only LDA . Yeah . Af - I  after that I added on - line normalization , yeah . PhD D: Mm - hmm . So we just tried directly to  to just , keep the system as it was and , um , when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh , signif significantly . Um , but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization . PhD A: Yeah , yeah . Yeah . PhD D: Because if we keep the value that was submitted uh , it doesn't help at all . You can remove on - line normalization , or put it , it doesn't change anything . Uh , uh , as long as you have the spectral subtraction . But , you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere , and we don't know where exactly PhD A: Yeah . PhD D: but , uh . PhD A: Yeah , I assume . Professor C: So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something PhD D: Right . PhD A: Yeah . PhD D: Yeah .

So there 's nothing on Professor C: I don't understand that . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: I guess I  I haven't been part of the discussion , so , um , it seems to me that the well - matched condition is gonna be unusual , PhD A: Usual . Professor C: in this case . Unusual .

It 's like , this is not calibrated by SNR or something . The well - matched has also some  some mismatch in that which is other than the Professor C: The well wa matched has mismatch ? PhD A: has  has also some slight mismatches , unlike the TI - digits where it 's like prefectly matched PhD F: Perfect to match . PhD A: because it 's artificially added noise . Professor C: Yeah . PhD A: But this is natural recording . Professor C: Yeah . So remind me of what well - matched meant ? PhD A: The  the well - matched is like Professor C: You 've told me many times . PhD A: the  the well - matched is defined like it 's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing . PhD D: Yeah . Well , so it means that if the database is large enough , it 's matched . PhD A: It 's  it 's PhD D: Because it PhD A: OK , it 's Professor C: Yeah . PhD D: in each set you have a range of conditions  Well Professor C: Right . So , I mean , yeah , unless they deliberately chose it to be different , which they didn't because they want it to be well - matched , it is pretty much  You know , so it 's  so it 's sort of saying if you PhD F: It 's  it 's not guaranteed though . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: Uh , it 's not guaranteed . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: Right . PhD D: Mm - hmm . PhD A: Yeah because the m the main  major reason for the m Professor C: Right . PhD A: the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually . Professor C: Again , if you have enough  if you have enough PhD A: No yeah , yeah . Yeah . Professor C: So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK , so you  much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you  you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and  and record noise conditions , or something , and then  I don't think that 's very realistic , I mean I th PhD A: Mm - hmm . Professor C: I  I you know , so I  I  I  you know , I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially , that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars , and  and you would have something that was roughly similar and maybe that 's the argument , but I 'm not sure I buy it , so . PhD A: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Professor C: Uh , So What else is going on ? PhD D: Mmm . You Yeah . We are playing  we are also playing , trying to put other spectral subtraction mmm , in the code . Um , it would be a very simple spectral subtraction , on the um , mel energies which I already tested but without the um frame dropping actually , and I think it 's important to have frame dropping if you use spectral subtraction . PhD F: Is it  is spectral subtraction typically done on the  after the mel , uh , scaling or is it done on the FFT bins ? PhD D: Um , PhD F: Does it matter , or  ? PhD D: I d I don't know . Well , it 's both  both uh , cases can i PhD F: Oh . PhD D: Yeah . So - some of the proposal , uh , we 're doing this on the bin  on the FFT bins , PhD F: Hmm . PhD D: others on the um , mel energies . You can do both , but I cannot tell you what 's  which one might be better or  I PhD F: Hmm . PhD A: I guess if you want to reconstruct the speech , it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bins . PhD D: I don't know . Yeah , but PhD F: Mmm . PhD A: But for speech recognition , it may not . I mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT . So you 're going to do a linear weighting anyway after that . PhD F: I see . PhD A: Well  Yeah ? PhD F: Hmm . PhD A: So , it may not be really a big different . PhD D: Well , it gives something different , but I don't know what are the , pros and cons of both . PhD A: It I Uh - huh . Professor C: Hmm . PhD A: So Professor C: OK . PhD A: The other thing is like when you 're putting in a speech enhancement technique , uh , is it like one stage speech enhancement ? Because everybody seems to have a mod two stages of speech enhancement in all the proposals , which is really giving them some improvement . PhD D: Yeah . PhD B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Mm - hmm . PhD A: I mean they just do the same thing again once more . Professor C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: And  So , there 's something that is good about doing it  I mean , to cleaning it up once more . PhD D: Yeah , it might be . PhD A: Yeah , PhD D: Yeah . PhD A: so we can PhD D: So maybe in my implementation I should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing PhD A: Yeah . That 's what Professor C: Well , the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing . PhD D: and  Yeah . Professor C: I mean maybe one or  one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first . PhD A: That 's wh Yeah . So , Professor C: Right , so he 's doing a signal subspace thing , maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction , or maybe vi maybe the other way around , PhD D: Yeah , mm - hmm . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: you know ? PhD A: So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace , PhD D: Mm - hmm .

PhD A: and then do a something in the second stage which could take it further . PhD D: What was your point about  about colored noise there ? PhD A: Oh , the colored noise uh PhD D: Yeah . PhD A: the colored noise  the  the v the signal subspace approach has  I mean , it  it actually depends on inverting the matrices . So it  it  ac the covariance matrix of the noise . So if  if it is not positive definite , PhD D: Mm - hmm . PhD A: I mean it has a  it 's  It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite ak It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite . Professor C: So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise . PhD A: So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering , first of the colo colored noise Professor C: Yeah . PhD A: and then make the noise white , Professor C: Yeah . PhD A: and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again . PhD D: Yeah , right . Professor C: I was only half kidding . I mean if you  sort of  you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid PhD A: Yeah . PhD D: Yeah . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: and then you  then  then add a little bit l noise  noise addition  I mean , that sort of what J  JRASTA does , in a way . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it 's equivalent to sort of adding a little  adding a little noise , PhD A: Huh ? Uh - huh . PhD D: Uh - huh . Professor C: in order to get rid of the effects of noise . PhD A: So . Professor C: OK . PhD D: Yeah . Uh , yeah . So there is this . And maybe we  well we find some people so that  uh , agree to maybe work with us , and they have implementation of VTS techniques so it 's um , Vector Taylor Series that are used to mmm ,  uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra . So . Well , if you take the standard model of channel plus noise , uh , it 's  it 's a nonlinear eh uh , transformation in the cepstral domain . Professor C: Mm - hmm . Yes . PhD D: And uh , there is a way to approximate this using uh , first - order or second - order Taylor Series and it can be used for  uh , getting rid of the noise and the channel effect . Professor C: Who is doing this ? PhD D: Uh w working in the cepstral domain ? So there is one guy in Grenada , PhD B: Yeah , in Grenada one of my friend . PhD D: and another in  uh , Lucent that I met at ICASSP . Professor C: Who 's the guy in Grenada ? PhD D: uh , PhD B: Uh , Jose Carlos Segura . Professor C: I don't know him . PhD A: This VTS has been proposed by CMU ? PhD D: Mm - hmm . PhD A: Is it  is it the CMU ? Yeah , yeah , OK . PhD B: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Originally the idea was from CMU . PhD A: From C . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor C: Uh - huh . PhD D: Well , it 's again a different thing   that could be tried . Um , Professor C: Uh - huh . PhD D: Mmm , yeah . Professor C: Yeah , so at any rate , you 're looking general , uh , standing back from it , looking at ways to combine one form or another of uh , noise removal , uh , with  with these other things we have , PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor C: uh , looks like a worthy thing to  to do here . PhD D: Uh , yeah . But , yeah . But for sure there 's required to  that requires to re - check everything else , and re - optimize the other things Professor C: Oh yeah . PhD D: and , for sure the on - line normalization may be the LDA filter . Um , Professor C: Well one of the  seems like one of the things to go through next week when Hari 's here , PhD D: I Professor C: cuz Hari 'll have his own ideas too  or  I guess not next week , PhD D: Uh - huh . Professor C: week and a half , uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans . Um . You know . So , I mean one way would  he Here are some alternate visions . I mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly , you pick on something that looks like it 's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same  different aspects of the same thing . Another thing would be to have t to  to pick two pol two plausible things , and  and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better , PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor C: and then , you know , uh , but , w um , uh , he 'll have some ideas on that too . PhD A: The other thing is to , uh  Most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks . But we  we going to address this Wall Street Journal in our next stage , which is also going to be a noisy task so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all . So , there are some  I mean , I was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks and spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks . And it 's  Always people have shown improvement with Wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere . But if we  if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization  to make it work @ @ . Professor C: So they 're making  there  Somebody 's generating Wall Street Journal with additive  artificially added noise or something ? PhD A: Yeah , yeah . Professor C: Sort of a  sort of like what they did with TI - digits , and ? PhD A: Yeah . Yeah . Professor C: Yeah , OK . PhD A: I m I guess Guenter Hirsch is in charge of that . Guenter Hirsch and TI . Professor C: OK . PhD A: Maybe Roger  r Roger , maybe in charge of . Professor C: And then they 're  they 're uh , uh , generating HTK scripts to PhD A: Yeah . Yeah , I don't know . There are  they have  there is no  I don't know if they are converging on HTK or are using some Mississippi State , Professor C: Mis - Mississippi State maybe , PhD A: yeah . I 'm not sure about that . Professor C: yeah . Yeah , so that 'll be a little  little task in itself . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: Um , well we 've  Yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too . But for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in Broadcast News . So we we did the Broadcast News evaluation PhD A: Mm - hmm . Professor C: and some of the focus conditions were noisy and  and PhD A: It had additive n Professor C: But we  but we didn't do spectral subtraction . We were doing our funny stuff , right ? We were doing multi multi uh , multi - stream and  and so forth . PhD A: Yeah . Professor C: But it , you know , we di stuff we did helped . I mean it , did something . PhD A: OK . Professor C: So . Um , now we have this um , meeting data . You know , like the stuff we 're  recording right now , PhD A: Yeah . Yeah . Professor C: and  and uh , that we have uh , for the  uh , the quote - unquote noisy data there is just  noisy and reverberant actually . It 's the far field mike . And uh , we have uh , the digits that we do at the end of these things . And that 's what most o again , most of our work has been done with that , with  with uh , connected digits . PhD A: Uh - huh . Professor C: Um , but uh , we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech , large vocabulary continuous speech , using Switchboard  uh , Switchboard recognizer , PhD A: Yeah . OK . Professor C: uh , no training ,  from this , just  just plain using the Switchboard . PhD A: Oh . You just take the Switchboard trained  ? Yeah , Professor C: That 's  that 's what we 're doing , PhD A: yeah . Professor C: yeah . Now there are some adaptation though , PhD A: OK . Yeah . That 's cool . Professor C: that  that uh , Andreas has been playing with , PhD A: OK .

PhD B: and you have the  on the other side you have the output of the mel filter bank . PhD A: Mm - hmm . PhD B: You can extend the coefficient of the mel filter bank and obtain an approximation of the spectrum of the signal . PhD A: Mmm . OK . PhD B: I do the difference PhD A: OK . PhD B: I found a difference at the variance of this different PhD A: Uh - huh . PhD B: because , suppose we  we think that if the variance is high , maybe you have n uh , noise . PhD A: Yeah . PhD B: And if the variance is small , maybe you have uh , speech . PhD A: Uh - huh . PhD B: To  to To  The idea is to found another feature for discriminate between voice sound and unvoice sound . PhD A: OK . PhD B: And we try to use this new feature  feature . And I did experiment  I need to change  to obtain this new feature I need to change the size  the window size  size . of the a of the  analysis window size , to have more information . PhD A: Yeah . Make it longer . PhD B: Uh , sixty - two point five milliseconds I think . PhD A: OK . PhD B: And I do  I did two type of experiment to include this feature directly with the  with the other feature and to train a neural network to select it voice - unvoice - silence  silence PhD A: Unvoiced . Well . PhD B: and to  to concat this new feature . But the result are n with the neural network I have more or less the same result . PhD A: As using just the cepstrum , PhD B: Result . PhD A: or  ? PhD B: Yeah . PhD A: OK . PhD B: Yeah . It 's neve e e sometime it 's worse , sometime it 's a little bit better , but not significantly . PhD A: Uh , is it with TI - digits , or with  ? PhD B: And  No , I work with eh , Italian and Spanish basically . PhD A: OK . OK . PhD B: And if I don't y use the neural network , and use directly the feature the results are worse . PhD A: Uh - huh . PhD B: But Doesn't help . Professor C: I  I  I really wonder though . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor C: I mean we 've had these discussions before , and  and one of the things that struck me was that  uh , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um  whenever you condense things , uh , in an irreversible way , um , you throw away some information . And , that 's mostly viewed on as a good thing , in the way we use it , because we wanna suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular , uh , phonetic units . Um , but , you 'll do throw something away . And so the question is , uh , can we figure out if there 's something we 've thrown away that we shouldn't have . And um . So , when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank , I was thinking \" oh , OK , so they 're picking on something they 're looking on it to figure out noise , or voice  voiced property whatever . \" So that  that 's interesting . Maybe that helps to drive the  the thought process of coming up with the features . But for me sort of the interesting thing was , \" well , but is there just something in that difference which is useful ? \" So another way of doing it , maybe , would be just to take the FFT uh , power spectrum , and feed it into a neural network , PhD B: To know Professor C: and then use it , you know , in combination , or alone , or  or whatever PhD F: Wi - with what targets ? PhD A: Voiced , unvoiced is like Professor C: Uh , no . PhD A: Oh . Or anything . Professor C: No the  just the same  same way we 're using  I mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank . PhD F: Phones . PhD A: Oh , OK . Professor C: Exact way  the same way we 're using the filter bank . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor C: I mean , the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it 's good . But it 's different . And , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing . And maybe , you know , using , orth you know , KLT , or uh , um , adding probabilities , I mean , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the  essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD A: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Yeah , but there is so much variability in the power spectrum . Professor C: Well , that 's probably why y i it would be unlikely to work as well by itself , but it might help in combination . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Mmm . Professor C: But I  I  I have to tell you , I can't remember the conference , but , uh , I think it 's about ten years ago , I remember going to one of the speech conferences and  and uh , I saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something , and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh , just putting in the FFT and the FFT did slightly better . So I mean the  i i It 's true there 's lots of variability , PhD D: Mm - hmm ."}

So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together .

Uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on . Postdoc F: OK . Professor E: And the  and the recordings also , Postdoc F: Um Professor E: just where we are . Yeah . Postdoc F: Well , so um , should we  we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or  ? Grad C: Well , we have about thirty - two hours uh as of , I guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours . Professor E: And  and that 's  that 's uh  How much of that is digits ? It 's uh  that 's including digits , Grad C: That 's including digits . Professor E: right ? Grad C: I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits . Professor E: So  Yeah . So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of  There 's got to be more than thirty hour PhD A: Mmm . Grad C: Of  of non - digits ? Professor E: i it couldn't  of  Of non - digits . Grad C: Yeah , absolutely . I mean , the digits don't take up that much time . Professor E: Yeah , yeah . OK . Postdoc F: OK , and the transcribers h I , uh , don't have the exact numbers , but I  think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . The next step is to  that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um  in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . Um , for example , i they 'll say uh \" ninety - two \" . And you know , so how  you could Grad C: Nine two , Postdoc F: e Exactly . Grad C: right . Postdoc F: So if you just say \" nine two \" , the  there are many s ways that could have been expressed . An - and I just had them  I  I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . PhD B: You know , Jane ? Grad C: Mm - hmm . PhD B: Um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in  in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them ,  a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of  inconsistencies and mis Grad C: Misspelled . PhD A: Yeah . Postdoc F: You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . Y you mean just uh  on each  on each line there 's a one word right ? It 's one token from the  from the corpus . PhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I  I agree that 's a very good use of it . PhD B: Oh so you already have that , OK . Postdoc F: Well that 's  that 's a way  that 's  You know , the spell - check basically does that but  but in addition  yes , that 's  that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon . PhD B: Mm - hmm . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh , Postdoc F: Exactly . And then you ca then you can do a s PhD A: Yeah . PhD B: i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and  and so it makes it easier . Postdoc F: Absolutely . I agree . That 's a very good  that 's a very good uh , suggestion . And that was  that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . I didn't get to that point but  So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then um , there 's a  he she wants the uh , actually a  an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either \" VOC \" for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , \" NONVOC \" for door - slam , and \" GLOSS \" for things that have to do with  if they said a s a spoken form with this  m this pronunciation error . Grad C: Right . Postdoc F: I already had that convention PhD B: Oh that 's great . Postdoc F: but I  I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most  ha most efficiently handled by uh  by a  a filter . That was what I was always planing on . So that , you know you get a whole long list  exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say \" curly bracket laugh curly bracket \" , PhD B: Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: then y you know it 's  it 's  You  you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space , PhD B: Yeah . Postdoc F: so man So many ways that error prone . PhD B: Right . Right . Postdoc F: So , um ,  um I 'm  I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments , and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying , PhD B: Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens PhD B: Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes . But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know I mean , jus Grad C: You don't know what they could be . PhD B: Yeah . Postdoc F: Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um  and PLP is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known , in  or  or have variant  u u uses like the numbers you can say \" nine two \" or you can say \" ninety - two \" , Grad C: So how are you doing the Postdoc F: and uh I 'd handle the numbers individually . Grad C: How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ? Postdoc F: It would be separate  The letters would be separated in space Grad C: OK . Postdoc F: and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is , Grad C: Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: so gloss of  whatever . Grad C: Right . Postdoc F: I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that . Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh  the you know ,  uh enumerated , or i Grad C: Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: it 's not a good way of saying  but it 's  it 's the  specific uh way of stating these  these letters . Grad C: Right . So it sounds good . Postdoc F: And so anyway , the clean  those are those things and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format . And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don . But that 's been my top priority  beyond getting it tanel channelized , the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins . PhD A: Yeah . Grad C: Right . Postdoc F: And uh , Thilo had a  e e a breakthrough with this  this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and I haven't  I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority  get the data clean , and channelized . PhD A: I actually gave Grad C: Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ? Postdoc F: Oh yes . Grad C: Okay , good . Postdoc F: Well you see that 's part of the cleaning process . I spent um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers , Grad C: Oh good . Good . Postdoc F: and I went through it last night , it 's  it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I  I left them discretion at commas . Grad C: Right . Postdoc F: Uh  and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions . Professor E: Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: And um , and  so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in  in huge patches of the data . And I have t ten minute stretch where I can  where I can show that . And  and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . So um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up \" gobbledy - gook \" . PhD B: Hmm . Postdoc F: And the other one didn't . And on this side , this one 's picking up things like \" neural nets \" and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't . Grad C: Right . PhD B: When  for the person who missed \" gobbledy - gook \" what did they put ? Postdoc F: It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . PhD B: Oh . Postdoc F: So they tried to approximate it , but it was PhD B: Oh good . Postdoc F: it was spelled GABBL PhD B: Sort of how it sounds . Yeah . Postdoc F: Yes . More of an attempt to  I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these  the a this  this was a sound  these are the sounds , Grad C: It was a technical term that she didn't recognize , PhD B: Yeah . Postdoc F: but  Yeah . But she knew that she didn't know it . Maybe it was a technical ter exactly . But she  even though her technical perception is just really  uh you know I 've  I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses Grad C: Right . Postdoc F: then cuz \" neural nets \" and  oh she has some things that are  oh \" downsampled \" , she got that right . PhD B: Hmm . Postdoc F: And some of these are rather  uh unexpected . Grad C: Obscure , yeah . Postdoc F: But ch ten solid uh  m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data .

Postdoc F: And so anyway , the clean  those are those things and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format . And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don . But that 's been my top priority  beyond getting it tanel channelized , the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins . PhD A: Yeah . Grad C: Right . Postdoc F: And uh , Thilo had a  e e a breakthrough with this  this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and I haven't  I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority  get the data clean , and channelized . PhD A: I actually gave Grad C: Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ? Postdoc F: Oh yes . Grad C: Okay , good . Postdoc F: Well you see that 's part of the cleaning process . I spent um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers , Grad C: Oh good . Good . Postdoc F: and I went through it last night , it 's  it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I  I left them discretion at commas . Grad C: Right . Postdoc F: Uh  and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions . Professor E: Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: And um , and  so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in  in huge patches of the data . And I have t ten minute stretch where I can  where I can show that . And  and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . So um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up \" gobbledy - gook \" . PhD B: Hmm . Postdoc F: And the other one didn't . And on this side , this one 's picking up things like \" neural nets \" and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't . Grad C: Right . PhD B: When  for the person who missed \" gobbledy - gook \" what did they put ? Postdoc F: It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . PhD B: Oh . Postdoc F: So they tried to approximate it , but it was PhD B: Oh good . Postdoc F: it was spelled GABBL PhD B: Sort of how it sounds . Yeah . Postdoc F: Yes . More of an attempt to  I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these  the a this  this was a sound  these are the sounds , Grad C: It was a technical term that she didn't recognize , PhD B: Yeah . Postdoc F: but  Yeah . But she knew that she didn't know it . Maybe it was a technical ter exactly . But she  even though her technical perception is just really  uh you know I 've  I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses Grad C: Right . Postdoc F: then cuz \" neural nets \" and  oh she has some things that are  oh \" downsampled \" , she got that right . PhD B: Hmm . Postdoc F: And some of these are rather  uh unexpected . Grad C: Obscure , yeah . Postdoc F: But ch ten solid uh  m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data . Professor E: And  and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ? Postdoc F: And um Professor E: Is that right ? Postdoc F: Yes exactly . Professor E: Yeah , OK . Postdoc F: And that 's part of this  Eleven hours . Professor E: Is that  is that  that including digits ? Yeah . Postdoc F: Yes it is . Professor E: So let 's say roughly  ten hours or so of Postdoc F: Mm - hmm . Professor E: I mean it 's probably more than that but  but with  of  of non - digits . PhD A: Yeah . Postdoc F: It 'd be more than that because I  my recollection is the minutes  that da digits don't take more than half a minute . Per person . Professor E: Oh , OK . Postdoc F: But um  the  the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape , Professor E: Oh , I see . Postdoc F: But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet . Professor E: Oh , I see . Postdoc F: So they 're still working  some of them are  Two of them are still working on completing that . Yeah . PhD B: Boy , they 're moving right along . Professor E: Yeah . Postdoc F: Yeah . They are . Mm - hmm . They 're very efficient . There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others . PhD B: Mm - hmm . Professor E: Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: Yeah . Professor E: So what  what  what 's the deal with  with your PhD A: The channel u thing ? Professor E: Yeah . PhD A: Oh , it 's just uh , I ran the recognizer  uh , the   speech - nonspeech detector on different channels and , it 's just in uh  in this new multi - channel format and output , and I just gave one  one meeting to  to Liz who wanted to  to try it for  for the recognizer Professor E: Oh , I see . PhD A: as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever , Professor E: Right . PhD A: and so  she  she will try that I think Professor E: Yeah . PhD A: and  I 'm  I 'm working on it . So , I hope Grad C: Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before ? Professor E: Yeah . PhD A: No . Uh , I  mmm , use some  some different features but not  not Grad C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: The basic thing is this HMM base . Grad C: So there 's still no  no knowledge using different channels at the same time . PhD A: There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels Grad C: You know what I mean ? Across all of them . PhD A: yeah . Grad C: OK . PhD A: So . But basically that 's one of the main changes . Grad C: Mm - hmm . Professor E: Mm - hmm . What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ? You said you 're trying some different features , or something . PhD A: Oh I just uh   Mmm , I just use um our loudness - based things now as they  before there were  they were some in  in the log domain and I  I changed this to the  to the Professor E: Cu - Cube root ? PhD A: Yeah . To  No , I changed this to the  to the  to the loudness thingy with the  with the Grad C: Hmm . Professor E: Ah . PhD A: how do you call it ? I 'm not sure . With the , uh Professor E: Fletcher Munson ? No . PhD A: I 'm not sure about the term . Professor E: Oh , OK . PhD A: Uh , I 'll look it up . And say it to you . Professor E: Yeah , alright . PhD A: Uh , OK , and  Yeah . That 's  that 's basically the  the  the thing . Yeah , and I  and I tried t to normalize uh  uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel , Professor E: OK . PhD A: because they 're ,  yeah to  to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . And it works quite well . But , not always . Professor E: Uh - huh . Uh - huh . PhD A: So . Professor E: OK . Grad C: Good . Professor E: Um , let 's see . I think the uh  Were  were you basically done with the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh  bleep editing . Grad C: Right . So the  The idea is that we need to have  We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece  pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: a single password . Each person will have a single password , user name and password . And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . And that way each person only has to remember one password . Professor E: I  I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . I mean if people have  Uh , I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . And then  um  if I thought it was OK , I 'd say \" it 's OK \" . Grad C: Mm - hmm . Professor E: And , I  uh  I mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare . Grad C: Right , I mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for  other reasons . Professor E: OK . Grad C: And so that  that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people  you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um  I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just uh , tell them , \" here 's the web page \" , um , \" you need a password \" . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it . Professor E: That 's  I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say  \" here is a  here is  \" I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but  but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , \" here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK \" . Grad C: I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . Professor E: And then they 'd hand it back to you . Grad C: But certainly I wouldn't want a printout . These are big , and I would much rather be  ha be able to just sit and leaf through it . Professor E: You find it easier to go through a large  I mean how do you read books ? Grad C: Well I certainly read books by hand . But for something like this , I think it 's easier to do it on the web . Professor E: Really ? I mean , it Grad C: Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I  I 'm  I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these . I wanna just be able to go to  go to the web site  and visit it as I want . Professor E: Going to a web site is easy , but flipping through a hundred pounds  a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web . Grad C: Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper . So . Professor E: Really ? Postdoc F: I have one question . So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? Because I  I do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the Professor E: So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong , Postdoc F: Yeah . Professor E: but the way I imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gonna go \" oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the  where 's the release ? \" And then there 'll be a subset of people , right ?  OK there 's  I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . PhD A: Yeah . Professor E: OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh \" well , yeah , I really would like to see that . \" And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document , I mean unless you 're searching . Searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not  so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that , PhD A: Yeah . Professor E: but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . Um if  if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out . I mean , so it 's  it 's  I mean , you  you 're  you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where  where I  I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go \" hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , \" and then that group would need it  S It seems like i if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy , Grad C: Well , no fre for the most Professor E: we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people Grad C: For the most frequent case they just say  \" it 's OK \" and then they 're done . And I think  almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method . Professor E: Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: The other thing too is it seems like Professor E: Um , yeah , that 's true . Postdoc F: Go ahead . Grad C: I mean , cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to . PhD A: Yeah . Professor E: I guess  Yeah , I guess we don't need their signature . I guess an email OK is alright . Grad C: Oh that was another thing I  I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it  that an email approval was sufficient . But  I don't actually know . PhD B: Are  are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ? Grad C: Yes . If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I  I  I think they should be allowed to do that . Postdoc F: I also  mm - hmm . PhD B: So that means other people are editing what you say ? Professor E: Uh  I don't know about that . Grad C: Yeah . PhD B: I don't know if I like that . Grad C: Well , the only other choice is that the person would say \" no , don't distribute this meeting at all \" , and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say \" don't distribute it at all \" . Professor E: But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice . Grad C: Well , but if  if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient . Professor E: Right ? Yeah . Yeah , but that 's our decision then . Right ? Grad C: Um , I don't think so . I mean , because if I object to the conversation . Professor E: I think it is . Grad C: If I say \" we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , \" and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side . Postdoc F: The  I agree that the consent forms were  uh , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that  um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them . Professor E: I see . OK , well , if that 's what it said . Postdoc F: And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that  uh , we wouldn't want someone to say \" oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but  it was too hard to access \" . So I think it 's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it . Now  in terms of like editing it by hand , I mean I think it 's  i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited . But  but it seems to me that sometimes um , you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice  it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK . Grad C: I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it . Um . Professor E: Um  I mean it 's also a mixture of people , I mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . Grad C: Yep . Professor E: Others would consider it  this uh  a  a set of skills that they would have to gain . You know ? Grad C: Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former . Professor E: It depends on what meetings . Postdoc F: That 's true . PhD B: So far . Grad C: So . Professor E: In the meetings so far , yeah . Grad C: Yep . Professor E: But we 're trying to expand this , right ? Grad C: Right . Professor E: So I  I  I actually think that paper is the more universal thing . Grad C: And that  Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright . Postdoc F: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Grad C: I think everyone in the meeting can access the web . Professor E: No , I think we have to be able to print it out . It 's not just if they want to print it out . I  I think Grad C: OK , so does that mean that I can't use email ? Or what ?

Professor E: There 's another aspect to this which maybe  is part of why this is bothering me . Um , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this . PhD B: Mmm . Grad C: I mean that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient . Professor E: I  I  I understand . PhD B: I know where you 're going . Professor E: I think that 's the bad idea . Grad C: Oh . Professor E: See because you 're gon you 're  uh  Really . You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the  the  the bias towards letting it go . Because nob you know it  There was a  one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , but overall people are talking about technical topics . Nobody 's gonna get hurt . Nobody 's being l libeled . You know , this is  this  we 're  we 're covering  We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're  we 're  we 're looking for the extreme case . If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache . That  I think that 's  I 'm sort of psyching myself out here , I  I 'm trying to  uh Grad C: I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out . Professor E: but I  I think that 's  Well , it 's Grad C: So . PhD B: I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped . Professor E: but i And  and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing . I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there  that 's missing from the dialogue . Grad C: Mm - hmm . Professor E: You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , PhD A: Yeah . Professor E: but it might be , uh  it might be really a  a pain . And , you know where it 's really gonna hurt somebody , in some way  the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about ,  we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence . And  and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , and so much fun !  that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff . Postdoc F: So much fun . Professor E: and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so \" well I didn't like what he said . \" Grad C: Well I don't see any way of avoiding that . I mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like . So that the Professor E: Yeah . No , no , I  I  I don't Grad C: The only question is Professor E: You - you 've talked me into that , but I  I just think that we should make it harder to do . Grad C: The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me . Whereas this web interface , I just get email , it 's all formatted , it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it . Professor E: So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it . So  so  so Postdoc F: Well I guess  Yeah . Professor E: I 'm sorry  so  so  So maybe this is a s a way out of it . Postdoc F: Hmm . Professor E: You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do  handle , and useful for someone else if they need it . But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh , they get access to this if they really need it . Grad C: Well PhD B: So you 're saying the  the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting . Professor E: Right . PhD B: And then if they don't , you 're done . If they do , then he provides them access to the  the web site . Grad C: Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords . Professor E: W w PhD B: Or  a printed - out form . Professor E: There 's  there Grad C: So , Professor E: y but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying . Grad C: Well , but Professor E: So PhD B: Only if they want it . Grad C: what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure . So they have to call me and ask . Professor E: No , no , no . But you aren't necessarily giving them  Right . But  we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all . Grad C: Well , we do because of privacy . We can't just make it openly available on the web . Professor E: No , no . You 're missing the point . Postdoc F: Mm - hmm . Professor E: We 're  We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this . Postdoc F: Not everyone gets a password , unless they ask for it . Professor E: Right ? So th so what I would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the Postdoc F: Yeah . Professor E: not just for fun , OK ? but to  to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at  from their memory . Um  and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review  go through how that 's worded , OK ? Then , if someone uh  wants to review it , uh , and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that  is that we then give them a print out . And then if they say that \" I have a potential problem with these things , \" then , you  you say \" OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that , \" you issue them a password , i in the Grad C: But the  the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me . Because that means multiple contacts every time  for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything . I would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to . Obviously they don't have to . Professor E: I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble Grad C: Yeah . Professor E: we have Grad C: So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen . Professor E: there 's a problem with it . Postdoc F: I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the  of the informed consent thing . Cuz I think if they feel that uh , it 's  I th I th You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , um , but  but they might be able to argue \" oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down \" . So it could that the burden would come back onto us . So I 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint . Professor E: Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think , Postdoc F: Yeah . Grad C: It seems to me that sending them email , saying \" if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK , Professor E: because  Uh - huh . Grad C: If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password \" , seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise . And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves . Postdoc F: Or we could print it up for them , PhD A: Yeah . Postdoc F: I mean we could offer that  but  but there 's uh , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , um , my impression is that they  that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . And  and I ha Professor E: Yeah . Postdoc F: I don't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage . I mean I  I thought that you were  Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it 's Professor E: Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean , that  having it Grad C: Having it . Postdoc F: Giving it to them . Grad C: Well the in Professor E: right ? It just means they have the right to have it . Postdoc F: OK . Grad C: the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it , Postdoc F: Alright . Fine . OK . Fair enough . Grad C: so . Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: D you want me to grab one ? Postdoc F: Sh - sh well I could  I 'm closer . Grad C: Yeah , but you 're wired Postdoc F: I could Grad C: aren't you ? Postdoc F: Yeah . That is true . Professor E: Um .  Yeah , I mean I don't wanna fool them , Postdoc F: I don't know Professor E: I just meant that e every  ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a  a bias that is presented , Postdoc F: Oh yeah yeah  oh I know .

I mean like  like Morgan was saying they  they Grad C: They just have to make sure that it is available to them . Postdoc F: It 's available to them if they ask for it . Professor E: Yeah , OK , so . wh um  I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , um , it 's a  it  we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . So I  I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , I mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . Grad C: Right . Professor E: That  that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out , Postdoc F: Good . Professor E: that it would be better for , um , our , uh , field if that is the case . But if you really think something is gonna  And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that  that is hurt by our expressing that bias . Postdoc F: Great . Great , great . Professor E: And then  then my concern about  which Postdoc F: Yeah . I agree . Professor E: you know you might be right , it may be it was just paranoia on my part , uh but people just  See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun  that people start bleeping stuff out   just as  just because they can . Grad C: It 's just a check box next to the text , it 's not any fun at all . Professor E: Yeah . Well I don't know . I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out . You know . Grad C: Well , but they won't get that feedback . Professor E: I Grad C: All  no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time . Professor E: Oh they won't ? Grad C: It just sends me Professor E: Oh good . So you haven't made it so much fun . Grad C: Right . Professor E: Oh good . Grad C: It just sends me the time intervals . Professor E: OK , Grad C: And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps . I mean I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: because um , then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space . Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: So I  I wanna  I  just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it . Professor E: OK . Alright , so I think  Yeah so if we have if  i Again let 's you know , sort of circulate the  the wording on each of these things and get it right , Grad C: Well since you seem to feel heart uh , strongest about it , would you like to do the first pass ? Professor E: but  but  OK . Uh , fair enough . Turn about is fair play , Postdoc F: Al - Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that  that Adam 's raised , uh about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever Professor E: Sorry . Grad C: Yeah . Postdoc F: and I don't know how that works . i There 's something down there about \" if you agree to  \" Professor E: I 'm  I 'm  I 'm  I thought  I  I thought about it with one of my background processes Grad C: I don't think so . Professor E: and I  uh it 's  uh it 's uh , it 's fine to do the email . Postdoc F: Ah . Fine . Grad C: Yeah because thi th they 're signing here that they 're agreeing to the paragraph which says \" you 'll be given an opportunity . \" Professor E: OK . Postdoc F: Good . OK . Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: And so I don't think they need another signature . Professor E: And  Well and furthermore I  it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that  that uh if it 's  if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying uh \" OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , \" uh if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now Grad C: Right . Professor E: so it 's  it 's OK . Postdoc F: Great . Professor E: Um . Grad C: So I guess I probably should at the minimum , think about how to present it in a printed form . I 'm not really sure what 's best with that . The problem is a lot of them are really short , Postdoc F: Well Grad C: and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line . But I don't know how else to do it . Postdoc F: Well I s I also have this  I  I think it 's nice you have it uh , viewab her  hearable on the  on the web for those who might wonder about um , the non nonverbal side , I mean I  I agree that our bias should be as  as expressed here , and  but I  I think it 's nice that a person could check . Cuz sometimes you know you  the words on a  on the page , come out soun sounding different in terms of the  social dynamics if they hear it . Grad C: Hmm . Professor E: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people  you know , shouldn't borrow trouble . What it comes down to but Grad C: Yeah I think actually  my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good . You know , if  if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that . Postdoc F: Oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole uh  i segment a against some   personal  i th Grad C: Right . That was all mumbled ? PhD A: Yeah . Grad C: I think Microsoft is Postdoc F: Yeah exactly PhD A: Oh , Grad C: Sorry transcribers . Postdoc F: Or  or even   or even  there was a  a line you know about how \" hmm - mmm - mmm  Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . \" Professor E: Yeah . Postdoc F: but  but it was all  the words were all visible , but they didn't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript . PhD A: Oh , God . Grad C: They 're gonna hate this meeting . PhD A: Yeah . Postdoc F: Yeah that 's true . Grad C: Actually Liz will like it . You know , but . Professor E: Liz will like it . We had a pretty strong disagreement going there . Grad C: Yep , yep , that 's right . Professor E: Yeah . Postdoc F: Yeah . So I don't know . I mean , I  I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that  that my double checking will be  so close to absolutely perfect that it  that nothing will slip by . Grad C: Mm - hmm . Professor E: But it  the  some something might sometime , and they  uh  if  if it 's something that they said , they might  i i I mean , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said , Postdoc F: Mm - hmm . Professor E: but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant . Postdoc F: I don't know how to notate that . PhD B: Sarcasm , Postdoc F: Yeah , that 's right . PhD B: how do you  how do you indicate sarcasm ? Postdoc F: Yeah that 's right . Professor E: No , I 'm serious . So  the  so  i the  so we might  we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was , you know , not  not really what I said . Grad C: Yeah . Well that would be good to get , definitely . Professor E: Yeah , but , Yeah , sure . Grad C: Just for corrections . Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: So um , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it , phone and in person . Or mail , physical mail . Postdoc F: Yeah . Or if for leave it on their voice mail . PhD B: Any sub - word level thing . Grad C: Any sub - wor Yeah , OK . I mean you could do it with PGP or things like that but it 's too complex . Postdoc F: You know I just realized something , which is of  e th this question about the  uh the possible mismatch of  I mean i well , and actually also the lawyer saying that um , we shouldn't really have them  have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks . You know ? Professor E: Mm - hmm . Postdoc F: I mean . So it 's like i in a way it 's  it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and  and hear the transcript , to have that be the Professor E: Well yeah , but you can't dep I mean , most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though . Postdoc F: Yeah , OK , fair enough . And they 're s they 're absorbing the responsibility themselves . Professor E: And they  they have to Postdoc F: So it 's not  it 's not um  Yeah , good . Professor E: But I mean if you were at a meeting , and  and you  you don't think , at least , that you said anything funny and the meeting was about , you know , some  some funny thing about semantics or something , or uh Grad C: You probably won't listen to it . Professor E: Yeah . Postdoc F: It is true that tec that the content is technical , I  and so i and we 're not having these discussions which Professor E: Yeah . Postdoc F: I  I mean , when I listen to these things , I don't find things that are questionable , in other people 's speech or in my own . Professor E: Yeah . You would think it would be rare , Postdoc F: Just  It should be very rare . Professor E: I mean we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have Postdoc F: Yeah . Yeah , OK . Grad C: How about them energy crises . Professor E: Yeah . I think we 're uh"}

Professor B: When we 're  yeah when we 're done . So  so Grad E: Hmm . Professor B: the  the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when so it 's , you know uh current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all , Grad E: Mm - hmm . Professor B: right ? And so that a decision would be do we want that so you could  two different things you could do , you could have all those values for Go - there or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when . Grad E: When . How . Professor B: Yeah and so forth . Grad E: Why , Professor B: So I 'll let Grad E: yeah . Professor B: we 'll see . Grad E: Hmm ? Grad A: I mean it seems that you could um uh it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would wanna have them separate or binary , Go - there and then the  the possibilities of how to go there because Professor B: OK , that 's  let 's start that way . Grad A: because , you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time . Grad E: Hmm . Hmm . OK . And so I 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe so who is the user ? Everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A . We should be be clear . But when it comes to sort of writing down when you  when you do these things is it here ? You sort of have to a write the values this can take . Professor B: Right . Grad E: And here I was really uh in some s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because um  this case it 's pretty simple , but as we will see the other ones um for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished . Grad A: Hmm . Professor B: No uh Grad E: How can I write here that this is something , a number that cr keeps on changing ? But OK . Thus is understandable ? Grad A: Think so . Grad C: Yes . Grad E: So here for example . Professor B: You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith , these belief - net things ? Grad A: Uh , no , but I think I 'm following it . So far . Grad E: So here is the  the  we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions . Professor B: Yeah . Grad D: Hmm . Grad E: There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things . Grad D: Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? OK , h well I mean how is it different from user finance ? Grad E: Um the finance is sort of here thought of as  as the financial policy a person carries out in his life , he  is he cheap , average , or spendy ? Grad D: Alright . Grad E: And um I didn't come uh maybe a user I don't know , I didn't want to write greediness , but Grad A: Yeah . Hmm . Professor B: Or cheapness . Grad E: Welcome . Grad A: User thrift . Grad E: Welcome . Professor B: Thrift , that 's good . Grad D: Yeah . Professor B: Great . Grad E: There it is . Professor B: Yeah . So Keith w what 's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So this is not just a display , this is actually a GUI to a simulator that will if we tell it all the right things we 'll wind up with a functioning belief - net at the other end . Grad A: OK . OK . Grad E: And it 's so simple even I can use it . Grad A: Wow , that is simple . Grad E: OK , so here was OK , I can think of uh people being cheap , average , or spendy or we can even have a  a finer scale moderately cheap , Professor B: Doesn't matter . Grad E: doesn't matter . Agree there but here um I wasn't sure what to write in . Professor B: Let 's  go ahead . Grad D: Well , I mean you 've written in  you 've written in what uh seems to be required like what else is  is do you want ? Grad E: If that 's permissible then I 'm happy . Professor B: Well yeah . So here 's  here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gonna have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? It 's  you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief - net . Right ? Grad E: Yeah . Professor B: And then what you 're going to need is uh for the things that it influences . Well let 's  first of all let 's see if it does influence anything . And if it does influence anything then you 're gonna need something that converts from the  the number here to something that 's relevant to the decision there . So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever  but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things . Grad E: Hmm . Yeah  this is where um OK anyways let 's forget it . Professor B: Well that 's fine . Well anyway , go ahead . Grad E: OK , and so this , oh that Grad D: The other thing is that um every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you  do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? Professor B: Yeah , that 's a good question . And uh does it have a lazy mode ? I don't remember . Grad D: Uh Well , I mean , in Srini 's thing there was this thing  there was this um option like proper inferences which suggests that uh doesn't happen , automatically . Professor B: Oh right . Yeah . S probably does . Yeah someone has to track that down , but I  but uh And  and  and I think  actually uh Grad E: I just accidentally Oops . Professor B: one of the we w items for the uh user home base uh should be uh essentially non - local . I they 're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they 're staying . Grad D: Well Grad E: Oh just uh accidentally erased this , I  I just had values here such as uh um is he s we had in our list we had \" Is he staying in our hotel ? \" , \" Is he staying with friends ? \" , and so forth Professor B: Yeah . Grad E: uh so we 're OK . Professor B: So it 's clear where w w w where we are right now . So my suggestion is we just pick uh Grad E: Something down here ? Professor B: one , you know one uh particular one of the uh well let 's do the first  first one let 's do the one that we sort of already think we did so w that was the  of the endpoint ? Grad E: Mm - hmm . And um Oops . Grad D: Is hmm Grad E: Ah , Grad D: So it 's true or false ? Professor B: No , that 's  that 's a Grad E: OK . No no no , EVA . Grad D: So Grad E: Missed that one ."}

Grad E: climb , emerge Professor B: No no no , these are ju that 's just a point , Grad C: Uh Grad D: Well some of those are subsumed by approach .

You know , you  y you go  first go the town square Grad C: Well I eh Grad A: No , I mean , if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your  your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge and doesn't really matter which way you cross which  where you end up at the end but the part  the good part is walking over it , so . Professor B: That 's subtle , but true . Anyway so let 's just leave it three  with three for now Grad E: Mm - hmm , mmm . Yeah . Professor B: and let 's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started . Grad E: OK , we Professor B: You 'll see it  you 'll see something comes up immediately , that the reason I wanna do this . Grad E: w well the uh user was uh definitely more likely to enter if he 's a local Professor B: Right . Right . Grad E: more likely to view if he 's a tourist um and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um Professor B: We did , but the three things w that  that it contributed to this in fact , the other two aren't up there . so one was the ontology Grad E: We 'll d what type of building is it ? Professor B: Yeah . Grad E: Yeah . Professor B: And the  and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse . Grad E: What he has mentioned before . Professor B: OK , so this is w Right , so what w I  what we seem to need here , this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff Grad A: mm - hmm Professor B: the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . So each of those the way we had it designed , now we can change the design , but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations Grad A: mm - hmm Professor B: so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes Grad E: Uh we can load it up it you know very simple . Grad A: So Professor B: and then what you and I have to talk about is , OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ? But the  they 're  they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about . Grad E: So this was adjusted for this one mode thing . Grad D: Oh yes . Professor B: Yeah . Grad E: So that 's w w in our uh in  in Johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something . Professor B: Oh , it was called mode , so this  this is m mode here means the same as endpoint . Grad E: Is now this endpoint . Grad C: Right . Professor B: OK , why don't we ch can we change that ? Grad E: We can just rename that , yeah . Professor B: Alright . You know , but that was actually , yeah unfortunately that was a um kind of an intermediate versio that 's I don't think what we would currently do . Grad A: Can I ask about \" slurred \" and \" angry \" as inputs to this ? Professor B: That 's a Grad A: What  why ? Grad D: Like they 're either true or false Grad E: The prosody ? Grad A: OK . Grad D: and they uh oh I see . Grad C: If the  if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK . Drunk . Grad D: Therefore Grad C: And , you know , possibly uh Grad A: Less likely to enter . Grad C: some , Grad A: Hmm . Grad C: yeah . Grad D: uh I was thinking less likely to view Professor B: Yeah . But that 's - that seems to , yeah . So  so my advice to do is  is get this down to what we think is actually likely to  to be a  a strong influence . Grad A: OK . Professor B: But yeah , that was what he had in mind . Grad D: Right . Professor B: So let 's think about this  this question of how do we wanna handle  so there 're two separate things . One is  uh at least two . One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that I think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . So the  let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing , the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter Grad A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: OK , et cetera . So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set , so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Now Grad E: Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in  in  in some of the other final decisions done here , for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um Professor B: Right . Right . Grad E: if it 's exhibiting itself it is a landmark , Professor B: Yeah . Grad E: meaning more likely to be viewed Professor B: Yep . Grad E: if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this , then it 's more likely to be entered . Professor B: I uh that 's  I think that 's completely right and um I think that 's good , right ? So what  what that says is that we might be able to uh take and in particular so  so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling Grad E: Accessibility . Professor B: no , accessibility meant Grad E: If it 's closed one probably won't enter . Or if it 's not accessible to a tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it , Professor B: OK . Grad E: given that he knows it , of course . Professor B: Alright . So let me suggest this . Uh w could you move those up about halfway . Uh The ones that you th And selling I guess ."}

So let me suggest this . Uh w could you move those up about halfway . Uh The ones that you th And selling I guess . Grad E: Yeah , all  all of these if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things Professor B: Right . So here  here 's what it looks like to me . is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of  of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . So that it uh that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other . Does that seem right ? So we di Grad C: Basic you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ? Professor B: if we Yes . Grad C: Yeah . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So if  well it may be more than endpoint decisions , so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three Grad E: These three ? Professor B: Yeah . Eh ser s uh selling , fixing , and servicing . Grad E: Yeah . Grad D: What ex um and so either those is true f or false ? Professor B: Uh Uh well it  it  i here 's where it gets a little tricky . Grad D: So Professor B: Uh from the belief - net point of view it is from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's  it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth . Grad A: Yeah . Professor B: So for this decision it 's just uh true or false Grad D: OK . Yeah . Professor B: and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want . Grad D: OK . Professor B: That  that if any of those things is true then it 's the kind of place that you uh Grad E: Um more likely to enter . Professor B: are more likely to enter . Grad D: So you just wanna have them all pointing to a summary thing ? Professor B: You could , yeah . Yeah , so let 's do that . No no , no eh to  to an inter no , an intermediate node . Grad D: T Grad E: Oh , OK . Professor B: That 's the p part of the idea , is Grad E: Um is  is that the object type node ? Professor B: I d Grad E: So are they the  is it the kind of object that sells , fixes , or services things ? Professor B: Well , o open up object type and let 's see what its values are . Grad E: Oh I just created it , it has none so far . Professor B: Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects , we called them entities , right ? Grad E: Yeah . And then we have sort of the um Professor B: Let 's say I put commercial . Grad E: Yeah , I w I was just gonna commercial action inside where people p Professor B: Well couldn't I do  let 's do commercial uh landmark and Grad E: And where was the accessible , yeah . Professor B: Well accessible I think is different cuz that 's tempor that  that varies temporally , Grad E: Yeah . Professor B: whereas this is a Grad E: Mm - hmm . Grad C: What would a hotel fall under ? Professor B: I would call that a service , but  but I don't know . Grad C: Well I mean in terms of entity type ? Professor B: Say w w well it 's co I would s a a again for this purpose I think it 's commercial . Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business . Grad C: OK . Grad D: Um what does the underscore - T at the end of each of those things signify ? Grad E: Um things . So places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things . Grad D: Uh - huh . OK . OK . That also points to entity type I guess . Grad A: So we 're deriving um this  the  this feature of whether the  the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ? Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity ? Professor B: Well you could , that 's a  that 's a choice . Grad A: OK . Professor B: So uh Grad A: I mean it seems like that 's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and you know indoor places that do something else Professor B: Yeah , the problem with it is that it sort of putting in a feature just for one decision , Grad A: and Hmm . Professor B: now w we may wind up having to do that this i anyway , this i Grad A: OK . Professor B: at a mental level that 's what we we 're gonna have to sort out . Grad A: OK . Professor B: So , you know what does this look like , what are  what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing , what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions Grad A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: and what 's the best way to organize this so that um it 's clean and  and consistent and all that sort of stuff . Grad A: OK . I 'm just thinking about how people , human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this and it would probably  you wouldn't just sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that it must be going on inside or something . Grad E: Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things , Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad E: it 's not either or mmm certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad E: Many come to mind . Things can be generally um a landmark and be accessible . IE a  a castle or can be a landmark a or not accessible , some statue Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad E: you know can go inside . Professor B: OK . Anyway so let me suggest you do something else . Uh which is to get rid  get rid of that l long link between who  the user and the endpoint . Grad E: Could we just move it like this ? Professor B: No no , I don't want the link there at all . Grad E: Oh , OK .

Professor B: let 's say underbar - U , so that 's the endpoint decision uh as seen through the Grad C: As related from the user model . Professor B: Right . So let 's  let 's actually yeah so lin you can link that up to the Grad E: Should I rename this  too ? Professor B: uh yeah , so that , I guess that 's endpoint uh Grad E: It 's underscore - E . Professor B: underscore - E for entity , and we may change all this , but . Right . And Grad E: OK , shouldn't I be able to move them all ? No . Or  ? Can I ? Where ? What ? Professor B: Oh I d eh I don't know . Actually , I guess the easiest thing would move  mo move the endpoint , well , go ahead . Just do whatever . Grad E: Wasn't this possible ? Professor B: Well . Grad E: Yeah . Grad C: I think you have to be in move mode before Grad E: Uh - huh . OK . Professor B: Good . Right . Grad E: So now we 're looking for user related things that um Professor B: Yeah . And uh maybe th maybe it 's just one who is the user , I don't know , maybe  maybe there 's more . Grad A: Huh . Grad E: Well if he 's usi if he 's in a car right now what was that people with Harry drove the car into the cafe Professor B: Never mind . Uh anyway , this is crude . Now but the  now so  so  but then the question is uh so  and  and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology , but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse . Grad E: Well let 's  should we finish this , Professor B: Sure , Grad E: I mean but surely the user interests Professor B: OK . Grad C: The user thrift , the user budget . Grad E: yeah , yeah Professor B: Well , maybe , I again , I d well , OK , put em in but what we 're gonna wanna do is actually uh Grad C: Well is Grad E: Here this was one of my problems we have the user interest is a  is a vector of five hundred values , so um That 's from the user model , Grad D: Oh you mean level of interest ? Grad E: mm - hmm , no not levels of interest but things you can be interested in . Grad A: Well Professor B: somebody else has built this user model . Grad D: Oh I see , Grad E: Gothic churches versus Baroque townhouses versus Grad D: right . So why is it oh it , so it 's like a vector of five hundred one 's or zero 's ? Grad E: Yea - n is that Grad D: Like for each thing are we  are you interested in it or not ? Grad E: yeah uh I  I think Grad D: I see . Grad A: Hmm . Professor B: OK . So uh you cou and so here let me give you two ways to handle that . Alright ? One is um you could ignore it . But the other thing you could do is have an  and this will give you the flavor of the  of what you could have a node that 's  that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , I 'm sorry and the user . Grad E: Mm - hmm . Uh . Professor B: So you could have a k a \" fit \" node and again that would have to be computed by someone else Grad E: Mm - hmm . Professor B: but uh so that uh Grad E: Just as a mental note uh Professor B: Yeah , that 's all . Grad E: Mm - hmm . And  and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of  of entering ? Professor B: Yeah . I mean , we could . Grad E: Yeah . And also if it 's an expensive place to enter , this may also Professor B: OK . Grad D: Budget . Grad A: User schedule . \" Do I have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the Koelner Dome  or do I just have to  \" \" time to take a picture of the outside ? \" Grad E: Schedule ? Professor B: Right . Grad C: It seems like everything in a user model a affects Professor B: Well that 's what we don't wanna do , see that  se cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that Grad C: Yeah . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: an Grad C: Cuz if the , I mean , and if the user is tired , the user state , Grad D: Well Grad C: right , it would affect stuff , but I can't see why e anything w everything in the model wouldn't be Professor B: Well , but Grad D: Right . Professor B: Well , that  that 's  we can't do that , so we we 're gonna have to Grad C: Yeah . Professor B: but this is a good discussion , we 're gonna have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate that uh so if there 's some general notion of for example the uh relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is  is the uh compatibility with his current state , so that 's what you 'd have to do , you 'd have to get it down to something which uh was itself relatively compact , so it could be compatibility with his current state which would include his money and his time and  and his energy Grad C: Yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level . Grad D: Right . Professor B: It does . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad C: Yeah , but Grad D: No but , it 's more than that , like the  the more sort of you break it up like because if you have everything pointing to one node it 's like exponential whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it 's not exponential anymore . Professor B: So it yeah , there are two advantages . That 's tha there 's one technical one Grad C: Sh - sh yeah , Professor B: and the other is it  it gets used Grad C: S so we 'd basically be doing subgrouping ? Subgrouping , basically into mo Grad D: Yeah . Grad C: so basically make it more tree like going backwards ? Grad D: Right . Grad A: Yeah . Professor B: Right . But it  there 's two advantages , one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential uh CBT 's , Grad E: Bhaskara ? Professor B: the other is it can be  it presumably can be used for multiple decisions . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So that if you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could well imagine that that was u Grad D: Right . Professor B: not only is it sim is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it 's used in multiple places . Anyway th so in general this is the design , this is really design problem . Grad E: Yeah . Professor B: OK , you 've got a signal , a d set of decisions um how do we do this ? Grad E: What do I have under user state anyhow cuz I named that already something . Oh that 's tired , fresh , yeah . Maybe should be renamed into physical state .

Professor B: What 's th what we 're talking about is compatibility . Uh or something , I don't know , but . Grad C: I guess the  the question uh is It 's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again . Or user compatibility . Professor B: Oh but the thing is that we uh uh we had some things that uh Grad E: That don't . Professor B: that don't Grad E: The user interests and the user who  who  who the user is are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke Grad C: Sure , but other  I thought though the node we 're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action , right ? Professor B: the right Grad C: Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something . Professor B: Uh maybe not . I mean the  that 's the  the issue is um would Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of . And anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible . Grad E: Maybe um if we look at the  if we split it up again into sort of um if we look at the uh the endpoint again we  we said that for each of these things there are certain preconditions so you can only enter a place if you are not too tired to do so and also eh have the money to do so if it costs something so if you can afford it and perform it is preconditions . Viewing usually is cheap or free . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad E: Is that always true ? I don't know . Grad C: Well , with the way we 're defining it I think yeah . Professor B: W w but that eh viewing it without ent yeah view w with our definition of view it 's free cuz you Grad E: And so is approaching . Professor B: Yeah . Grad A: Well what about the Grand Canyon , right ? No , never mind . I mean are there  are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to like , I mean never mind , not in the current Professor B: No we have to enter the park . Grad A: OK . Professor B: Eh almost by definition um paying involves entering , Grad A: Yeah . Professor B: ge going through some Grad A: OK . Right , sure . Professor B: Right . Uh So let me suggest we switch to another one , I mean clearly there 's more work to be done on this Grad E: Mm - hmm . Professor B: but I think it 's gonna be more instructive to  to think about uh other decisions that we need to make in path land . And what they 're gonna look like . Grad C: So you can save this one as and open up the old one , right and  and then everything would be clean . You could do it again . Professor B: Why , I think it 's worth saving this one but I think I 'd  I 'd like to keep this one Grad D: Yeah . Professor B: cuz I wanna see if  if we 're gonna reuse any of this stuff . Grad C: Mm - hmm . Grad E: Um so this might be What next ? Professor B: Well you tell me , so in terms of the uh planner what 's  what 's a good one to do ? Grad E: Well let 's  th this go there or not I think is a good one . Professor B: Uh Grad E: Is a very basic one . So what makes things more likely that Professor B: Well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse . Grad E: So Professor B: So Keith this is gonna get into your world because uh we 're gonna want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties Grad A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor B: s and so I  I don't yet know how to do this , I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So that  that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse , and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for Grad E: We  we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint . Professor B: Of  of course . Grad E: Identified that Professor B: Yeah . Grad E: and so again re that 's completely correct , we have the user model , the situation model here , we don't have the discourse model here yet . Much the same way as we didn't  we don't have the ontology here . Professor B: Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth . Grad E: Really . Professor B: So in some sense it 's  it 's there . Grad E: Mm - hmm . Professor B: But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet . Grad E: Yeah . Um This be specific for second year ? Um And  and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint . Professor B: But if we do it 'll have the three values . Grad E: Hmm ? Professor B: It 'll have the EVA values if  if we have it . Grad E: Yeah . Yeah . OK just for starters and here discourse um Professor B: For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . That 's what we talked about . Grad E: um well , I think um we 're looking at the  the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad E: So this should sort of push it in one direction Professor B: Right . Grad E: however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there . Professor B: Mm - hmm . Grad E: And sometimes um people say where is it Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad E: because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably Professor B: Yeah , but that doesn't change the fact that you 're  you want these two values . Grad E: Oh yeah , true . So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either  yep , yay , A , or nay . Yeah . OK ? Professor B: And they 'll be a y uh , a user Go - there and maybe that 's all , I don't know . Grad D: Situation Go - there , I mean , because it 's  whether it 's open or not . Grad E: Mm - hmm . Professor B: OK , good . Grad D: That definitely interes Professor B: Yep . Grad D: But that now that kind of um what 's the word Grad A: Hmm . Grad D: um the  that interacts with the uh EVA thing if they just wanna view it then it 's fine to go there when it 's closed whereas if they want to um Professor B: Right . Grad D: so Professor B: Right , so that 's  that 's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting , so what uh Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it 's closed or not Grad A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: in terms of uh uh you know , whether  whether you wanna go there . Grad D: The time of day , Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad D: right I  well , right . Grad C: It does matter though if there 's like a strike or riot or something . Professor B: Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter . Grad D: Right . So yeah , that 's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this  that node by itself wouldn't distinguish Professor B: Well i i it can have di various values . Yeah , but we eh you  you 're right it might not be enough . Grad D: Yeah , I mean , see I 'm  I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false .

Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed  feed into the Go - there S That 's right , Grad D: Yeah , right . Professor B: so the Endpoint node , Grad E: Mm - hmm . Professor B: make that up t t to the Go - there then Grad E: Yeah . Professor B: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that . Now it 's gonna be important not to have loops by the way . Uh really important in  in the belief worl net world not to have loops Grad E: I was just gonna Professor B: uh Grad D: Yes . Grad E: How long does it take you to  to compute uh Professor B: No it 's much worse than that . It  if i loo it  it  it  it  it 's not def i it 's not well defined if you 're there are loops , Grad D: It  things don't converge , yeah . Grad E: uh R recursive action ? Professor B: you just you have to there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't uh OK . Grad E: Uh but this isn't , this is  this line is just coming from over here . Grad D: Yeah . Professor B: Yeah , no it 's not a loop yet , I 'm just saying we  we , in no , in Grad D: Yeah . Well , but the good thing is we  we could have loopy belief propagation which  we all love . Grad E: Mmm . Professor B: Right . OK , so anyway , so that 's another decision . Uh what 's  what 's another decision you like ? Grad E: OK , these have no parents yet , but I guess that sort of doesn't matter . Right ? Professor B: Well , the idea is that you go there , you go comes from something about the user from something about the situation and the uh the discourse is  is a mystery . Grad E: I mean this is sort of This comes from traffic and so forth , yeah . Sh - Should we just make some Professor B: Sure , if you want . Grad E: um if there 's parking maybe Mmm Oh who cares . OK . And if he has seen it already or not and so forth , Professor B: Right . Grad E: OK . Um and discourse is something that sort of should we make a Keith note here ? Professor B: Sure . Grad E: That sort of comes from Keith . Professor B: Mm - hmm . Grad E: Just sort of so we don't forget . Oops . Have to get used to this . OK , whoops . Grad A: Um actually Professor B: And then also the discourse endpoint , I  I guess endpoint sub - D is  if you wanna make it consistent . Grad C: Wh - ah . Grad E: Mm - hmm . Grad A: Um actually is this the  the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because isn't the , I mean Professor B: I think so . S Grad A: uh , hmm OK . But that still allows for the possibility of the  of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from Professor B: Maybe not , a Right . Grad A: That  all that  that kind of decision making happens at the Go - there node . Professor B: Uh y you  yeah you  i you  if you needed to do that . Grad A: Uh . If you needed it to do that . Professor B: Yeah . Grad A: But uh OK I was just thinking I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible  possible asking of the user Professor B: Yeah . Grad A: you know hey there 's a strike on , uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something Professor B: Ah . Good point , I don't  I don't know how we 're going to  t uh Grad A: or Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model but , you know , directly out of interaction . Professor B: Right . Uh I gu yes my curr you know , don't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough . Grad E: Yeah . Professor B: Uh My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things Grad A: OK . Professor B: you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ? Grad A: Yeah . Professor B: But uh if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ? Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK . Professor B: But I think trying to formulate the conditional question , that sounds too much . Grad A: Right , right . Yeah . Right , sure , OK . Grad E: it 's X  X - one voted for A X - two voted for V Grad E: and so forth ?"}

Um . Yeah . So I  so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . Um so move to next s slide . User Interface: So my job is to uh design a Google TV controller  which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So User Interface: That's the end of the talk  the end of the presentation . Project Manager: So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful . User Interface: Uh  With sophisticated functions , Project Manager: So powerful , User Interface: but with very  yeah powerful . Project Manager: many functions and very easy to use . User Interface: Yes . Yep . Marketing: So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , Industrial Designer: To merge the two system huh . Marketing: I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: You mean this one ? Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose . Industrial Designer: Mm yep . Industrial Designer: But But this is User Interface: But if we have very very good user interface Marketing: Yeah , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: and then User Interface: it take less time for user to learn how to use it . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah you  maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are  or almost the same , so the sign . Project Manager: Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . Marketing: Oh it should  okay , yeah . The user should know . Industrial Designer: So you have to  The sh the user there  for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that  So . Project Manager: Yeah um such as maybe the Industrial Designer: Yeah . So . Project Manager: Go on , go back and Industrial Designer: Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright . Marketing: Yeah , that's gonna be the trick .

And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so  doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh , Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Marketing: remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . Marketing: So this is from the experiments we've done , Marketing: so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . Project Manager: What is R_S_I_ ? Marketing: R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um  doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Ah um okay . Marketing: Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . Industrial Designer: Okay . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Marketing: And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , User Interface: Functions . Marketing: this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay . Industrial Designer: Okay . Marketing: So Project Manager: Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Sure ? Yeah ? User Interface: Yeah , I think possible . Because we can  We can uh mix uh several function in one button . Project Manager: Yeah .

They also expressed their hope that the government would do more to help the people of the affected areas.", "relevant_text": "The Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 20thmeeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a reminder to all members, in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not be connected to the video conference. I want to remind those who are participating by video conference that, when they talk, they must use the channel that corresponds to the language they are speaking in. As usual, please direct your remarks through the chair. We are moving on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on. We will now move on to document submissions. The honourable minister, Mr. Blair. Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness): Mr. Chair, today I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 2019 annual report on the RCMPs use of the law enforcement justification provisions. This report addresses the RCMP's use of specified provisions within the law enforcement justification regime, which is set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the Criminal Code. This report also documents the nature of the investigations in which these provisions were used. The Chair: On tabling of documents, we have Minister Sajjan. Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence): Mr. Chair, pursuant to Standing Order 32, I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 2018-19 progress report on Canada's national action plan for the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security. The Chair: Now we'll go to presenting petitions. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of a special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Members who are participating in the meeting in person are kindly asked to bring the signed certificate to the office once the petition has been presented. Presenting petitions, Ms. May. Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, I rise to present two petitions. They both pertain to the protection of our natural world. One is an e-petition, and it relates to the threat to pollinators globally. We know that honey bees and other pollinators are essential to food production. The petitioners note that research from around the world points to a threat to pollinators, particularly from a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids. The European Union has taken action on this. The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to practise a precautionary principle and remove from use neonicotinoids in Canada to protect our pollinators. The second petition relates to the ongoing threat to the southern resident killer whales. These iconic whales are much beloved in SaanichGulf Islands, throughout coastal British Columbia and indeed across Canada. The petitioners are calling for more action to be taken as the population of southern resident killer whales continues to decline, more action for boat-free safety zones, more prohibitions around whale tourism to make sure that the whales are safe from those who are keen to watch them from too close a distance, and more of a credible enforcement regime to support these measures to keep the southern resident killer whale population in our waters and not on the list of species that have become extinct. The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Genuis. Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Mr. Chair, for over 10 years, members of Parliament from various parties have been trying to pass legislation to deal with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. Irwin Cotler, Borys Wrzesnewskyj, Senator Salma Ataullahjan and I have all proposed bills on this. The petitioners want the House to support Bill S-204. This is another bill that would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. I'm sure petitioners would want me to add that, given the urgency of this issue, perhaps the government could consider bringing forward a government bill on this issue, which would allow the process to move much faster. The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Cannings. Mr. Richard Cannings (South OkanaganWest Kootenay, NDP): Mr. Chair, I rise here today to present a petition from Canadian citizens in support of motion M-1, which was placed in this House by my colleague the member for New WestminsterBurnaby on the green new deal. These citizens point out that climate change has escalated into a global climate emergency and that Canada must act with ambition and urgency. They call on the government to support M-1, a made in Canada green new deal, to take bold and rapid action to adopt socially equitable climate action to tackle the climate emergency and address worsening socio-economic and racial inequalities at the same time while ending fossil fuel subsidies, closing offshore tax havens, and supporting workers impacted by the transition by creating well-paying, unionized jobs in the shift to a clean and renewable energy economy. The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Johns. Mr. Gord Johns (CourtenayAlberni, NDP): Mr. Chair, it's an honour and privilege to table e-petition 2577, which was sponsored by Chris Alemany from Port Alberni and is supported by 5,183 petitioners. They're calling on the Government of Canada to work urgently across party lines and in partnership with provincial and territorial governments to implement a guaranteed, consistent, national and livable universal basic income system for all Canadians. The petition is very timely, coming almost one year to the day since the completion of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which also called on the government to establish a guaranteed annual livable income for all Canadians. Whether it's about providing a safety net to get through a global pandemic, the means to keep your children out of poverty at any time, or simply being able to afford safe housing or transportation, it's time for Canada to have this conversation. The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Manly. Mr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Mr. Chair, it's an honour and a privilege to present a petition on behalf of the constituents of NanaimoLadysmith. People are concerned about gas fracking and the use of methane and the destruction that methane causes to our atmosphere and with climate change. They're calling on the government to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on the Wet'suwet'en territory, and by ordering the RCMP to dismantle their exclusion zone and to stand down. They also call on the government to schedule nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentswhich is something that we're happy to see has been happening and I commend the government for that effortand to prioritize the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Chair: Next is Mr. Lamoureux. Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.): Mr. Chair, like Canada, Guyana is part of the Commonwealth, and many constituents of Winnipeg North have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in March, when it was being called into question. There have been some very positive indications in recent days, but the petitioners are asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to be aware of what's taking place in Guyana, and as much as possible, to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we're being diligent in supporting what the people of Guyana want to see. The Chair: I just want to remind the honourable members, when presenting petitions, to be as concise as possible. I notice they're starting to stretch a bit and it's something we all tend to do. Now we'll go to Statements by Members. The first statement will be from Mr. Lefebvre. Mr. Paul Lefebvre (Sudbury, Lib.): Mr. Chair, I just want to say thank you to the industrious people of Sudbury who have risen to the challenge and joined forces in the face of COVID-19. I am proud of all my constituents, and all Canadians, including first responders, volunteers, health care and essential workers, local miners, the farmers and produce growers who are feeding our families, and local businesses who are staying connected with their staff. I also salute all our homegrown innovations such as ProStitch and King Sportswear face masks; Crosscut Distillery hand sanitizer; Nobel Prize winner SNOLAB's work on ventilators, which earned a federal contract; Vale Canada's $1 million in seed capital to small firms developing COVID-19 health solutions; and many more.  We are all in the same boat, but we will get out of it together. The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Dalton. Mr. Marc Dalton (Pitt MeadowsMaple Ridge, CPC): Mr. Chair, Pitt Meadows is one of Canada's most beautiful communities. It's tucked in between the Fraser and Pitt rivers and is in the shadow of Golden Ears mountain. Most of the area consists of farmland, golf courses, parks and conservation areas. It also has Pitt Lake, which is among the largest freshwater tidal lakes in the world. Pitt Meadows' history dates back thousands of years with Katzie First Nation. In the 1900s Dutch immigrants drained and diked the marshes allowing for today's bumper crops of cranberries and blueberries. It's hard to believe that this community is only a short commute to Vancouver and has one of the nation's busiest general aviation airports. Last weekend the community came together to celebrate Pitt Meadows Day a little differently because of COVID. In a great show of community spirit, from their front yards and balconies, thousands of residents came out to cheer for first responders and essential workers as we paraded throughout the city. I am thankful to have raised my family here, taught in the schools and to now be the member of Parliament representing this wonderful community. The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Kelloway. Mr. Mike Kelloway (Cape BretonCanso, Lib.): Mr. Chair, over the last few months I have watched constituents in my riding come together to look out for one another during these challenging times. Regardless of how deep and painful this pandemic has been, it continues to amaze me just how brightly the collective character of Cape BretonCanso shines through. Whether it is someone like Glen Muise, who delivers iPads to seniors' homes so they can connect with loved ones, teachers who deliver meals to students in need, Liam and Lucus Sakalauskas, two young boys who keep youth informed across the east coast, or Rose Fitzgerald, who delivered bouquets made from the remaining flowers from her shop to essential workers across her county, constituents in Cape BretonCanso have stepped up to support their community and to support those in need. Mr. Chair, as you know it is with great pride that I represent my constituents in Cape BretonCanso. The people in Cape Breton and northeastern Nova Scotia care deeply about one another. They know that as a community, we're only as strong as our most vulnerable people, and I cannot help but be filled with joy when I see these gestures happening across my riding. Thanks so much. The Chair: Ms. Brub, go ahead. Ms. Sylvie Brub (AbitibiBaie-JamesNunavikEeyou, BQ): Mr.Chair, unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member Romeo Saganash, whose commitment I commend, to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the Viens commission in Quebec. The Bloc is open to the idea, but we shouldn't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action. There are already potential solutions for taking action. Commissions have been issuing reports for decades, and Ottawa has been tabling them. Last year alone, the Viens report and the report stemming from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls contained dozens of recommendations. The federal government must work with indigenous peoples, Quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces. Civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the RCMP. Police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures. Hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation. Let's take action. The Chair: I give the floor to Mr.MacKinnon. Mr. Steven MacKinnon (Gatineau, Lib.): Mr.Chair, on behalf of myself and my parliamentary colleagues, I want to congratulate students from our high school class of 2020. We know that, owing to the pandemic, graduation celebrations will be different this year, as students will be deprived of their prom, their graduation ceremony and, in some cases, their goodbyes to friends and teachers. I know how disappointed students from the high schools of duVersant, LeCarrefour, Nicolas-Gatineau, de l'rablire, Collge Saint-Alexandre, Collge Nouvelles Frontires, Collge Saint-Joseph, Philemon-Wright and other regional schools, are not to be able to celebrate their five years of incredible efforts surrounded by their families and friends who were by their side on a daily basis. However, that takes nothing away from their accomplishment. So when they receive their diploma, here is what I will say to them: Surge ahead! The future belongs to you. Be ambitious, follow your dreams and, most importantly, continue to change the Outaouais and the world! The class of 2020 will be remembered for a long time. The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Morantz. Mr. Marty Morantz (CharleswoodSt. JamesAssiniboiaHeadingley, CPC): Mr. Chair, I am delighted to rise to talk about the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre, which is now under construction in my riding in Winnipeg. This state-of-the-art addictions recovery facility was made into a reality by Scott, Anne and Darcy Oake in memory of their son and brother Bruce, who passed away tragically from an accidental overdose in 2011. The Bruce Oake Recovery Centre will provide help to thousands of Manitobans to manage their addiction and reintegrate into the community. I was proud to support this project when I voted for it during my time on Winnipeg City Council. The addictions crisis in Canada needs action. With approximately eight million Canadians suffering from addictions, we need centres like these to help them recover so that no other family will face a heartbreaking loss due to addiction. I want to congratulate the Oakes for their commitment to making recovery for many a reality. Addictions affect us all, and we all have a part to play in contributing to the solution. The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Jowhari. Mr. Majid Jowhari (Richmond Hill, Lib.): Mr. Chair, I would like to recognize the compassion and generosity demonstrated in my riding of Richmond Hill. Week after week residents and organizations have come together to support our most vulnerable during a time of great difficulty. I want to thank the champions of the community who were generous enough to donate masks and other supplies as well as services. I would also like to recognize the charities and care centres which, upon receiving these donations, redoubled their efforts to serve their communities. Special thanks go to the Mon Sheong Foundation Long-Term Care Centre, Divine Favour Senior Homecare, the Community & Home Assistance to Seniors, the True Compassion Home Health centre, Blue Door, the Mosaic Interfaith Out of the Cold program, Yellow Brick House, Hill House Hospice, Community Living York South, and Parya Trillium Foundation for continuing to support the residents in my riding of Richmond Hill. The compassionate generosity demonstrated by these donors and organizations makes me proud to represent my community in Parliament. The Chair: We'll now go to Madam Lalonde. Mrs. Marie-France Lalonde (Orlans, Lib.): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Usually, at this time of the year, I have the pleasure of being invited to the graduation ceremony of the grade12 students in Orlans. However, we will all have to adapt to a new reality this year. I cannot express enough how, in these exceptional times, I have witnessed the strength, resilience and community spirit of our graduates. I also know that a number of high schools have made significant efforts to celebrate the success of their graduating class. Young graduate Maryanne Collard was amazed to see that people from her school, the cole secondaire catholique Batrice-Desloges, had installed a sign in her garden to congratulate her on her academic success.  As we move forward we must not forget that youth in this country are our future. We have a responsibility to be there for them and to believe in them. We will not fail.  I thank the teachers, the support staff and school management who are continuing to do their work. Congratulations to all graduates of 2020. The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Vis. Mr. Brad Vis (MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, CPC): Mr. Chair, COVID-19 has changed and challenged how we go about our daily lives. For many this includes a shift to working from home or attending school remotely. The sad reality is that even before the crisis hit, most rural Canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable Internet connection, even though Internet is an essential service. Those in underserved areas, including many parts of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, cannot work from home and their children cannot keep up with their classmates. For many of my indigenous constituents, Internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies don't want to serve them. I, along with my colleagues, launched community consultations to address this critical issue and provide solutions. We call on the government to outline and implement a concrete action plan to address Internet connectivity deficits between rural and urban Canada. This is an issue I will continue to press on until results are achieved. The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. McLeod. Mr. Michael McLeod (Northwest Territories, Lib.): Mr. Chair, Canada has been awarded its first-ever Equator Prize from the United Nations Development Programme. Congratulations go to Lutsl K' Dene First Nation and the Northwest Territory Mtis Nation, with support from Deninu K'ue First Nation and the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, for the establishment of the Thaidene Nn territorial protected area. It's 14,000 square kilometres of the most beautiful land and waters you'll find anywhere on earth. I would also like to thank the previous minister of the environment for securing Canada's $7.9-million commitment, along with our visit to celebrate the new park last year. The award is given to groups that have exemplified actions to protect critical ecosystems and biodiversity for generations to come and to show how indigenous peoples and local communities have confronted legacies of disadvantage and discrimination in support of their communities and the world at large. Congratulations to Lutsl K'. The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Falk. Mrs. Rosemarie Falk (BattlefordsLloydminster, CPC): Mr. Chair, the Liberal government has tabled $87 billion in spending and allocated just four hours for Parliament to study, debate and pass it. The allocated time is wholly inadequate. Canadians deserve to know how that money is being spent. They deserve to know that this government spending was scrutinized and passed through the rigours of Parliament. It is Canadian taxpayers of today and tomorrow who will have the responsibility to pay for this government's spending. It is Canadian workers and businesses who will have to do the hard work of rebuilding our economy. It is real Canadians who fall through the cracks when this Liberal government's programs fail to meet their intended goals. A rubber stamp under the guise of health and safety is not democracy. Canadians are owed better. Just as we gather four days a week for a hybrid committee meeting, parliamentarians can gather to do the full scope of the work that Canadians elected us to do. The Chair: We now go to Mr. Godin. Mr. Jol Godin (PortneufJacques-Cartier, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Our planet is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our daily lives have been turned upside down. I am thinking of you, our seniors, valuable individuals who built our country. You have gone through a very restrictive confinement. You have had to sacrifice time spent with your families. Our students also had to adapt. Their school year was turned on its head. Our graduating class, especially, saw their dream of a proper graduation vanish. The future belongs to them. They must follow their dreams. I want to say to all the essential staff and the many support organizations that they are really changing things. We have all taken on our important responsibility, that of following the guidelines. The results have been most compelling in my riding. I want to say how proud I am to represent you here, in the Canadian Parliament. I thank each and everyone of you. You are helping PortneufJacques-Cartier flourish. You have shown resilience, creativity, innovation and solidarity. That is commendable. Together, we will get through this ordeal and come out stronger. The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Gazan. Ms. Leah Gazan (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): Mr. Chair, today I rise to honour Justice 4 Black Lives Winnipeg, led by women and non-binary individuals, who stood together and mobilized our city to state clearly that we will not stand by and stay silent in the face of police brutality. We will not stand by in the face of systemic racism. We will not stand by while we witness our bodies being abused by centuries of racism supported through legislation that has left us vulnerable at the hands of those who abuse their power. We will speak out against police violence. We will speak out against systemic racism. We will join together to ensure that laws are instituted that are designed to protect us, not abuse us. We will call out those who abuse their power. We will rise. We will rise. We will rise. To all the women and non-binary folks who are standing, I say, let's continue to sound our voices in solidarity and support of one another until indigenous and black lives are honoured and respected. Our liberation is intertwined. Solidarity. The Chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille, go ahead. Mrs. Claude DeBellefeuille (SalaberrySurot, BQ): Mr.Chair, this is not the time for governments to get complacent about COVID-19. However, the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless Prime Minister. First, he locked down Parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition, while the economic recovery must be prepared. He is refusing to provide an economic update, even though the Parliamentary Budget Officer is calling for it. We need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic. He is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers. The increase Quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave, and not after it. Finally, today, he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed. He is behaving as if he had a majority government. This is not a time for recklessness. Governing means anticipating. I am asking the Prime Minister to pull himself together. The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Uppal. Hon. Tim Uppal (Edmonton Mill Woods, CPC): Mr. Chair, I rise to give thanks and recognition to the contributions of many businesses and organizations across my riding of Edmonton Mill Woods that have stepped up in a major way during this pandemic. I joined my friends in the Filipino community who partnered with Mill Woods' Calvary Community Church to deliver care packages to seniors. Varinder Bhullar and his Green Scholars of Alberta team and Dil-E-Punjab restaurant provided thousands of free meals. Sikh Youth Edmonton delivered free groceries to families, seniors and students. Edmonton Towing and its full team with Dukh Nivaran Gudwara prepared food packages for any truckers who were coming through Edmonton.

For many this includes a shift to working from home or attending school remotely. The sad reality is that even before the crisis hit, most rural Canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable Internet connection, even though Internet is an essential service. Those in underserved areas, including many parts of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, cannot work from home and their children cannot keep up with their classmates. For many of my indigenous constituents, Internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies don't want to serve them. I, along with my colleagues, launched community consultations to address this critical issue and provide solutions. We call on the government to outline and implement a concrete action plan to address Internet connectivity deficits between rural and urban Canada. This is an issue I will continue to press on until results are achieved. The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. McLeod. Mr. Michael McLeod (Northwest Territories, Lib.): Mr. Chair, Canada has been awarded its first-ever Equator Prize from the United Nations Development Programme. Congratulations go to Lutsl K' Dene First Nation and the Northwest Territory Mtis Nation, with support from Deninu K'ue First Nation and the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, for the establishment of the Thaidene Nn territorial protected area. It's 14,000 square kilometres of the most beautiful land and waters you'll find anywhere on earth. I would also like to thank the previous minister of the environment for securing Canada's $7.9-million commitment, along with our visit to celebrate the new park last year. The award is given to groups that have exemplified actions to protect critical ecosystems and biodiversity for generations to come and to show how indigenous peoples and local communities have confronted legacies of disadvantage and discrimination in support of their communities and the world at large. Congratulations to Lutsl K'. The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Falk. Mrs. Rosemarie Falk (BattlefordsLloydminster, CPC): Mr. Chair, the Liberal government has tabled $87 billion in spending and allocated just four hours for Parliament to study, debate and pass it. The allocated time is wholly inadequate. Canadians deserve to know how that money is being spent. They deserve to know that this government spending was scrutinized and passed through the rigours of Parliament. It is Canadian taxpayers of today and tomorrow who will have the responsibility to pay for this government's spending. It is Canadian workers and businesses who will have to do the hard work of rebuilding our economy. It is real Canadians who fall through the cracks when this Liberal government's programs fail to meet their intended goals. A rubber stamp under the guise of health and safety is not democracy. Canadians are owed better. Just as we gather four days a week for a hybrid committee meeting, parliamentarians can gather to do the full scope of the work that Canadians elected us to do. The Chair: We now go to Mr. Godin. Mr. Jol Godin (PortneufJacques-Cartier, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Our planet is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our daily lives have been turned upside down. I am thinking of you, our seniors, valuable individuals who built our country. You have gone through a very restrictive confinement. You have had to sacrifice time spent with your families. Our students also had to adapt. Their school year was turned on its head. Our graduating class, especially, saw their dream of a proper graduation vanish. The future belongs to them. They must follow their dreams. I want to say to all the essential staff and the many support organizations that they are really changing things. We have all taken on our important responsibility, that of following the guidelines. The results have been most compelling in my riding. I want to say how proud I am to represent you here, in the Canadian Parliament. I thank each and everyone of you. You are helping PortneufJacques-Cartier flourish. You have shown resilience, creativity, innovation and solidarity. That is commendable. Together, we will get through this ordeal and come out stronger. The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Gazan. Ms. Leah Gazan (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): Mr. Chair, today I rise to honour Justice 4 Black Lives Winnipeg, led by women and non-binary individuals, who stood together and mobilized our city to state clearly that we will not stand by and stay silent in the face of police brutality. We will not stand by in the face of systemic racism. We will not stand by while we witness our bodies being abused by centuries of racism supported through legislation that has left us vulnerable at the hands of those who abuse their power. We will speak out against police violence. We will speak out against systemic racism. We will join together to ensure that laws are instituted that are designed to protect us, not abuse us. We will call out those who abuse their power. We will rise. We will rise. We will rise. To all the women and non-binary folks who are standing, I say, let's continue to sound our voices in solidarity and support of one another until indigenous and black lives are honoured and respected. Our liberation is intertwined. Solidarity. The Chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille, go ahead. Mrs. Claude DeBellefeuille (SalaberrySurot, BQ): Mr.Chair, this is not the time for governments to get complacent about COVID-19. However, the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless Prime Minister. First, he locked down Parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition, while the economic recovery must be prepared. He is refusing to provide an economic update, even though the Parliamentary Budget Officer is calling for it. We need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic. He is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers. The increase Quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave, and not after it. Finally, today, he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed. He is behaving as if he had a majority government. This is not a time for recklessness. Governing means anticipating. I am asking the Prime Minister to pull himself together. The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Uppal. Hon. Tim Uppal (Edmonton Mill Woods, CPC): Mr. Chair, I rise to give thanks and recognition to the contributions of many businesses and organizations across my riding of Edmonton Mill Woods that have stepped up in a major way during this pandemic. I joined my friends in the Filipino community who partnered with Mill Woods' Calvary Community Church to deliver care packages to seniors. Varinder Bhullar and his Green Scholars of Alberta team and Dil-E-Punjab restaurant provided thousands of free meals. Sikh Youth Edmonton delivered free groceries to families, seniors and students. Edmonton Towing and its full team with Dukh Nivaran Gudwara prepared food packages for any truckers who were coming through Edmonton. The Bhartiya Cultural Society Hindu temple provided free meals to anyone who needed them. Punjab Insurance and The Punjab chain of restaurants provided free meals in downtown Edmonton. The staff, nurses and doctors of Grey Nuns Community Hospital in the heart of Mill Woods have been keeping people safe and healthy. I want to thank our Mill Woods community as a whole for its continued strength, resilience and compassion as we move forward together. The Chair: We'll now proceed to Mr. Fonseca. Mr. Peter Fonseca (Mississauga EastCooksville, Lib.): Mr. Chair, today is Portugal Day, celebrated both in Portugal and around the world by Portuguese. In Canada, June has been recognized as Portuguese Heritage Month. We're truly happy to recognize the great contributions made by Canadians of Portuguese descent. This year is a difficult one, though, for all of us, including our Portuguese diaspora community across the globe that is deeply affected by the COVID situation. Our prayers and well wishes are with everyone. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our luso community of over half a million members in Canada from coast to coast for staying strong during these difficult times. Your warmth, hard work and team spirit resonate well across my riding of Mississauga EastCooksville and globally. As a Portuguese immigrant who came to Canada at the age of two with my family, I know this year will be a lot different from previous years. I encourage all of you to stay safe and enjoy a Portuguese meal, and please continue to support our local businesses. The Chair: We now begin the period of questions for ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice in order to allow employees who provide support for sitting to substitute each other very safely. The first question goes to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Scheer. Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister is doing everything to avoid being accountable to Canadians. He is refusing to table a budget, refusing to provide an economic update and refusing to let the House of Commons do its work. Will he at least provide the Auditor General with the additional funding she needs to look into government expenditures? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Mr.Chair, not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help Canadians with the Canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities, but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that. I hope the opposition parties will allow a vote and a debate in the House on this important bill. Hon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister wants parliamentarians to vote on aspects of the government's spending. We want the Auditor General to be able to examine that government spending. Under the government, the Auditor General has had to do more with less, and her ability to conduct audits is being affected. The Auditor General has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits, despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending. I have a simple question. Will the Prime Minister give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job, yes or no? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we worked with the Auditor General to increase the funding of the Auditor General's office in 2018-19, and the equivalent of 38 full-time staff were added. We support the Auditor General, unlike the Conservative government, which fired 60 people from the Auditor General's office. We are now proposing that we sit down to debate legislation this afternoon, and I certainly hope that members opposite will vote for debate. Hon. Andrew Scheer: The Prime Minister is again engaged in revisionist history. He well knows that it was the Auditor General's office that volunteered to make administrative efficiencies, which did not affect its ability to do the job. In fact, as the interim auditor general, John Wiersema, said, We would not have proposed if we didnt think it was the right thing to do and that wed be able to carry out our role for Parliament. Only the government's refusal to grant that extra funding is hampering the Auditor General's ability to give Canadians the answers they deserve, and we wonder why. This is the government that cannot explain where 20,000 infrastructure projects went and where five billion dollars' worth of supposed infrastructure investments have gone. They can't identify that. Then there is, of course, the $35-billion Infrastructure Bank, which has completed precisely zero projects. Are these the reasons the Prime Minister is so intent on withholding funds from the Auditor General? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, talking of revisionist history, Stephen Harper's Conservatives cut $6.5 million from the Auditor General's budget and fired 60 staff. On the contrary, we worked with the Auditor General's office and increased its funding and added the equivalent of 38 new full-time staff. We will continue to demonstrate openness and transparency. We will continue to respect the officers of Parliament, whom the Conservatives, in their time in office, showed no respect for. We will continue to move forward in a way that has led, for example, to proposing debate and voting on important legislation this afternoon to help Canadians. The Conservatives don't seem to want that debate or vote. Hon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it's no surprise that the Prime Minister likes to reach back into history from before the 2015 election to justify his position. The 2015 election was the only time he got more votes than the Conservative Party did, so I understand why he likes to live in the past. In May, the interim auditor general said, Ten years ago, we were completing about 27 performance audits every year. With our current resources, we expect to be able to deliver 14 performance audits each year. That's half the number of audits, despite a massive explosion in government spending. The Auditor General's office has requested more funds to be able to do the job that Canadians expect to be done. Will the Prime Minister give those additional funds to the Auditor General's office, yes or no? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we very much look forward to working with the new Auditor General to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions. Speaking of what is foundational to our institutions, this afternoon we're putting forward a bill that would help Canadians across the country, and we've proposed to debate and vote on that bill. It actually looks like the Conservatives and other opposition parties might not want this. They have been complaining about not having debates and votes in Parliament, and now they're proposing not to have them. That's a little head-scratching. We hope they're going to help Canadians. The Chair: We will continue with Mr.Blanchet. Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. We may have a chance here to replace a problem with a good opportunity. This morning, we heard many groups and organizations that represent people with a disability express their concerns over the bill introduced by the government, which I feel is chocolate pudding containing cod liver oil. We agree with the chocolate pudding. We are favourable to helping people with a disability. People don't know the rules. They don't knowI am telling them nowthat a bill can be divided. It can be cut into parts and voted on in parts. The rest of the bill can be enhanced. I am saying to the Prime Minister that, if he presents the part on disabled individuals, it will be passed at the speed of light. He won't even see it happen. Is he prepared to divide the bill, so that we can work together to help people with a disability? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: The bill that we are proposing this afternoon will certainly help people living with disabilities. We can always recognize that this is important, and every party should be open to it. We will also increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit from four-week intervals to two weeks. We will also expand the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses will have access to it. I am always willing to work with members of the opposition to ensure that we adopt these measures, all or some of the measures. We want to help Canadians. We look forward to debating and voting on this later today. Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: It is a glorious day. I heard all or some of the measures. That means that we are not adopting them all at the same time and that the bill is being split. Can the Prime Minister confirm that he is in fact going to split his bill so that we can address the various components separately, since they have nothing to do with each other, and improve them, in keeping with our mandate as elected officials? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Our goal on this side of the House, and it is shared by all members of the House, is to help Canadians during the pandemic. We have put forward a number of measures that will help Canadians in a tangible way. Yes, that includes Canadians living with disabilities, but it also includes businesses that cannot, but should be able to, access the wage subsidy. In addition, we are going to make the Canada emergency response benefit more flexible. I look forward to continuing the discussions The Chair: Mr.Blanchet has the floor. Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: We almost had some clarity, but one swallow does not make a summer. Yes, there is a need for discussions on the Canada emergency response benefit. The government says that it wants to transform the program into something very coercive, without admitting that the lack of an employment incentive has essentially sabotaged another program, the wage subsidy. That deserves some thought. That is what we are elected to do. We do not need to spend eight months on this, we can fix it in a few hours. When the government says that we are going to have to vote on this, it means rubber stamping its bill. We have the right to debate it, to have discussions and to improve it. I watched the election on the night of October21. It was a beautiful night. It was more fun than a hockey game. People elected a minority government. Can the government admit that? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: We are not proposing only to vote on this bill this afternoon, we are proposing to debate it. It is the role and responsibility of all of us in the House to exchange ideas and to work together to help Canadians. That is exactly what we are proposing this afternoon. It is about helping people with disabilities, increasing the flexibility of the CERB, and expanding the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses have access to it. I look forward to debating this with my colleagues opposite. The Chair: Mr.Blanchet, you have 43seconds left. Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: That will be enough. I would be remiss if I allowed the Prime Minister to mislead people quite unintentionallyI say this in accordance with the Standing Orders. When we introduce a bill, we discuss it at second reading, we vote, we continue to discuss it and we send it to committee. All that can be done very quickly. However, we must be able to amend and improve this bill. That is how the normal Parliament works. The government doesn't like being in a minority situation. It behaves as if it were a majority government, but it is not. Can we follow the real procedures of Parliament, do a proper job, and then have a vote that is likely to suit the majority of members, not just the Prime Minister? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, my hon. colleague seems to completely forget that we are going through a pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis requires different actions on our part. That is why we provided the text of the bill to the opposition parties four days ago. We have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill, if they had amendments to propose. That is how we are taking action to help Canadians quickly during this crisis, and that is what we will continue to do. The Chair: Mr.Singh, you have the floor. Mr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP): Mr.Chair, will the Prime Minister make a clear and direct commitment today to extend the CERB for families who need it? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help Canadians living with disabilities, will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit. We hope to be able to debate it. Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB for families in need, yes or no? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: As I said, Mr. Chair, discussions are ongoing on that, but I can assure Canadians we will continue to be there for them and support them, as we have been. Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, a family that needs to buy groceries can't take those pretty words and buy groceries with them. We're asking the Prime Minister to extend the CERB for families in need. Will the Prime Minister do that, yes or no? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to be there for Canadians in the right way. We are engaged with stakeholders, with opposition parties and with Canadians to ensure that we continue to support them the way they need to be supported. Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, I can tell you what the right way is. Don from Burnaby sent me a note saying he's an arts worker and there is no forecast for his job to be reopened. He is now dependent on the CERB. He wants to go back to work, but there's no work. He sent an email saying he's faced with a grim realityhis wordsand he's frightened that if the CERB runs out, and it is planned to run out at the end of this month, then he will have no way to afford to make ends meet. Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB so Don does not have to live in fear? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, as I said, and as we have been saying from the beginning, we will continue to be there to support Canadians who need it. The member opposite is not actually looking at the fact that we are proposing three significant helps for Canadians this afternoon. We are proposing to help Canadians with disabilities, to expand the wage subsidy for more businesses and to create flexibility for the CERB. He doesn't even want to debate those things. He doesn't even want to be voting on them. Will the NDP allow us to move forward on these important measures for Canadians? Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, let's talk about those measures. One of the things we asked the government to do five weeks ago was to bring in help for Canadians living with disabilities. Now the government's plan is only going to help 40% of Canadians living with disabilities. Will the government commit to helping all Canadians living with disabilities and propose a plan that will do so? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the NDP leader seems to have decided that rather than help 40%, or a significant portion, of people with disabilities, he wants to help none of them, because he's not going to allow the debate to move forward on this bill. That's unfortunate. We're always happy to look at how we can do more. We have demonstrated from the beginning that we want to do more for Canadians. I look forward to working with the NDP. I am hoping those members change their minds and allow us to have an important debate this afternoon. Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, I appreciate that the Prime Minister accepts that his plan only helps 40% of Canadians living with disabilities. Let's talk about the 60% who aren't being helped. They are veterans living with disabilities, those who receive CPP and those who receive disability payments. Often it's the poorest of Canadians living with disabilities who won't be helped with the plan the government is proposing. Will the government help all Canadians living with disabilities? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, our proposal will help 100% of Canadians who receive the disability tax credit, including many veterans. The fact is that we are there to support the disability community. We are there to support Canadians with disabilities. Why is the NDP not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation? The Chair: Mr. Singh, we have 43 seconds for a question and an answer. Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, that's the exact problem with the Liberal proposal. It's a tax credit approach, which excludes the vast majority of Canadians living with disabilities. That is the wrong approach. We made it very clear that if the government extends the CERB, if it ensures there are no penalties on those who are desperately in need of help and if it helps all Canadians living with disabilities, we will move forward. Will the government do that? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, as I have said from the beginning, we look forward to continuing to work with the members opposite to keep moving forward to help Canadians. However, we need the opposition parties to actually choose to help Canadians and not to play political games. I hope we're going to be able to actually have a debate and a vote on this important legislation this afternoon. The Chair: We're now going to take a short pause to allow staff to change up in a safe way respecting COVID-19 procedure. The floor now goes to Mr. Rayes. Mr. Alain Rayes (RichmondArthabaska, CPC): Mr.Chair, can the Prime Minister tell us whether we will have an economic update by the end of June?"}

Mr. Alain Rayes (RichmondArthabaska, CPC): Mr.Chair, can the Prime Minister tell us whether we will have an economic update by the end of June? Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance): Mr.Chair, I would like to thank the hon. member for his question. It is of course very important to be transparent. When the situation is stable, we will have The Chair: Once again, the floor goes to Mr.Rayes. Mr. Alain Rayes: Mr.Chair, most of the provinces in Canada are working on tabling economic updates by the end of June. Why is the Liberal government unable to do so as well? Hon. Bill Morneau: I understand the importance of transparency and that is why we are trying every day to explain our investments to Canadians and to continue to be transparent with them. Mr. Alain Rayes: The Liberal government announced hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending during the pandemic, but it still refuses to provide an economic update in order to be transparent with Canadians. In times of crisis, monitoring the situation is more important than ever. I repeat my question: why does this government not want to table an economic update by the end of June, when the provinces are doing so? Hon. Bill Morneau: Every day, we explain the economic situation, our investments, the changes we are making, and our programs to improve the situation of Canadians during the pandemic. We will continue our approach to being transparent. Mr. Alain Rayes: The Parliamentary Budget Officer himself does not understand why the federal government cannot deliver an economic update when the provinces can. Why are the government and the minister defying the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who is an independent officer and is requesting an economic update? Hon. Bill Morneau: We will continue with our approach, which is one of transparency. We know that it's very difficult to make projections given the very dynamic nature of the situation. We think our approach of providing information daily is appropriate and we will continue to be transparent about our investments. Mr. Alain Rayes: That is incredible. When we listen to the minister and the Prime Minister talk, you would think we were in the pesky terrible twos phase that children go through, when they keep saying no, no, no. I find it funny that the provinces are able to table an economic update in a crisis situation. The opposition parties are asking for it, as are experts and officials. When the time comes for the government to listen to the scientists, it has no problem doing so. However, if people do not think like the government, it ignores them. The provinces are doing it, the opposition parties are calling for it and the Parliamentary Budget Officer is calling for it. Why will the Minister of Finance not table an economic update so that all members of Parliament can do their verification work? Hon. Bill Morneau: I will continue to provide daily information on our measures and investments. Projections are clearly very difficult to make. However, when the situation is more stable, we will be able to provide more information to Canadians. In the meantime, we will be adapting to the situation on a daily basis and making sure that we have the information we need to make our decisions and to make sure that Canadians understand our situation. The Chair: Mr.Rayes, you have 45seconds left. Mr. Alain Rayes: Mr.Chair, one month ago, the Prime Minister announced with great fanfare that the eligibility criteria for the $40,000emergency loans for businesses would be more flexible to help self-employed entrepreneurs and businesses that pay themselves dividends to have access to them. However, as of todayit has been four weeks since that announcementbusinesses are still banging their heads on the doors of their financial institutions. They do not have access to the information because it is not available on official websites. In addition, even senior officials confirmed to me during a technical call on June2, last Tuesday, that this information would not be available for several weeks. Can the Minister of Finance, who says he wants to act quickly to help our businesses, explain why, after four weeks, it is still not possible to get the information the Prime Minister promised us from his doorstep? Hon. Mona Fortier (Minister of Middle Class Prosperity and Associate Minister of Finance): Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been listening and responding to small businesses and entrepreneurs across the country. In fact, we have even announced the expansion of the program's eligibility criteria to include many owner-managed small businesses with payrolls of less than$20,000. The new criteria have forced financial institutions to adapt to be able to provide this program to new applicants. We are working around the clock to ensure that we are able to promptly provide small businesses across the country with the assistance they need. The Chair: We will now proceed to Mr. Allison. Mr. Dean Allison (Niagara West, CPC): Mr. Chair, Canada's unemployment rate stands at 13.7%. That's the highest it's been in almost four decades. Many industries, like travel, hospitality and tourism, are getting crushed. We rely on a lot of hospitality and tourism in my riding of Niagara West. Can the government tell us what their plans are to help the travel, hospitality and tourism industry that so many of my constituents depend on? Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages): Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for his important question. I had a good conversation with the mayor of Niagara Falls recently, and we believe in the importance of the tourism sector. That's exactly why we've extended the wage subsidy until the end of August. There is the CEBA loan, the $40,000 loan. There is also spending through FedDev in my colleague's region. If he has clear, specific projects in the tourism sector that he needs help with, I would ask that he please come and see me and have a conversation. Mr. Dean Allison: Mr. Chair, the message from the president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Perrin Beatty, and also other industries, is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what's going to happen through the strategy. What I've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence. What is the government doing to make this happen? Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we absolutely agree. It is important for businesses to have an understanding of the programs that we've put in place. We have been consulting with businesses on the appropriate way to extend the wage subsidy so that we can continue to support businesses as they turn towards a safe restart. We've also looked very carefully at how we can ensure that the programs that we've put forward The Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Allison. Mr. Dean Allison: Mr. Chair, this government has come way short of meeting the Canadian demand for personal protective equipment. Some equipment procured from overseas has been substandard and couldn't be used. Because of the shortage, in my riding of Niagara West, dentists have to pay up to 10 times the amount for an N95 mask. Compared to early March, when will the government finally begin to produce enough PPE in Canada to meet Canadian demand? Hon. Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry): Mr. Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for his question. We have mobilized over 700 Canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in Canada as part of a made-in-Canada initiative. We're going to continue to work with industry to build up domestic capacity. Mr. Dean Allison: Global News is reporting that Canada is struggling to secure a reliable source of PPE. What's the evidence of this? We know that the government procured 10 million substandard N95 masks that couldn't be used. Masks were sent back to suppliers for having flaws. We received mouldy swabs to be used in COVID-19 tests. Planes are arriving empty that should have been filled with PPE, and we received less than 5% of our total order of gloves. It's clear that Canada needs to rely on Canada for PPE. When will this government finally begin to take PPE equipment issues seriously and make enough in Canada to meet demands by Canadians? Hon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement): Mr. Chair, the honourable member's questions were tainted with inaccuracies. Regarding the flights that returned from China without federal cargo, Air Canada did reimburse the federal government for that amount. In addition, with regard to the N95 masks that were referenced, the Government of Canada will not pay for masks that it does not use. Furthermore, as my colleague Minister Bains just stated, we are mobilizing and retooling the domestic industry. Over half of the face shields that we have received were produced in Canada. Mr. Dean Allison: At a time when the Prime Minister has ordered Canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed, at a time when Canadians have had to say goodbye to their relatives over Skype, at a time when Canadians are not allowed to get married, at a time when Canadians are being fined for taking their kids to the park, at a time when restaurants are being fined $800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced, in these times, the Prime Minister's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing. Mr. Chair, why is it that there seems to be one set of rules in this country for some people but a different set for the Prime Minister? Why the double standard? Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health): Mr. Chair, as the member knows, this country has been gripped with the need to stand up with one another to fight the experience of racism that so many Canadians live with and that so many of our American cousins live with. As the member knows, local public health sets advice for regions that he specified, and I would encourage all Canadians to check with local public health advice before they resume activities. The Chair: Now we'll go to Mr. Chiu. Mr. Kenny Chiu (StevestonRichmond East, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Many Canadian veterans are noticing that medical providers are increasing their costs. Everything is more expensive these days, including medicine, etc. It can take upwards of a year for Veterans Affairs to adjust their rate scale to compensate, and they do not allow for retroactive reimbursement. What are the government's actions to alleviate this hardship for our men and women who stood guard for this country, our veterans? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Veterans Affairs): Mr. Chair, the fact is that when we inherited the government, Veterans Affairs needed a lot of support from government. In fact, at that time, we invested $10 billion to make sure that Veterans Affairs was put in place and that we could provide the appropriate supports for veterans, like the pension for life, the centre of excellence on PTSD and the chronic pain centre of excellence. All of these things are so important. We have to realize that with government previously The Chair: We'll now go back to Mr. Chiu. Mr. Kenny Chiu: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Minister, for answeringor respondingto my question, although that really did not provide an answer, in my humble opinion. Part of the side effect of spending hundreds of millions of dollars is inflation. My constituents in StevestonRichmond East are overwhelmingly finding this government's support for seniors inadequate. The opposition has put forward clear proposals, such as a one-time tax-free withdrawal being allowed for an RRSP or a RRIF. So far, the government has not taken any action on this. Why is the government ignoring suggestions to help Canadian seniors? Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors): Mr. Chair, I want seniors to know that they are not alone. To help preserve their registered retirement income fund assets, we are reducing minimum withdrawals by 25% for 2020. We're also providing direct financial support so that seniors can get the help they need now. As the market is volatile during this time, we continue to look at all ways that we can best help seniors during this difficult time. Mr. Kenny Chiu: Mr. Chair, the Hong Kong government has arrested 9,000 civilians just in the past year. This is equivalent to the arrest of 42,000 people, proportional to Canada's population. It is anticipated that more unjust incarcerations will occur as Beijing imposes the national security law in Hong Kong. Has our government started preparing a list of names for Magnitsky-style sanctions, yes or no? Hon. Marc Garneau (Minister of Transport): Mr. Chair, as we have said, we and our allies are deeply concerned with Beijing's decision to impose a national security law on Hong Kong. With hundreds of thousands of Canadians living in Hong Kong, we have a vested interest in its stability and prosperity, the foundations of which are Hong Kong's relative autonomy and basic freedoms. The proposed law would also undermine the one country, two systems framework. Mr. Kenny Chiu: I thank the minister for responding. Again, however, words are not enough. It's time for action, because the Chinese embassy has said, in response to Canada's expressed concern, that they deplore, reject and condemn our response and our concerns thus far. What are the conditions for this government using Magnitsky sanctions should China continue to incarcerate Canadians and jeopardize the human rights of its citizens? Hon. Marc Garneau: Mr. Chair, we have been very clear. We will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the Hong Kong population. Canada will always support and promote freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world. The Chair: Mr. Chiu, we have about 22 seconds, so you have time for a very quick question and hopefully a very quick answer. Mr. Kenny Chiu: Okay, here's a quick question. The Communist Chinese government has lied about COVID-19. They have issued statements against Canada and they have yet to release the two Canadians being held hostage. My constituents are concerned over this. When will this government listen to Canadians and call for a stronger, more effective and truly independent international investigation into COVID-19's origin? The Chair: The honourable minister has 22 seconds or less, please. Hon. Marc Garneau: Mr. Chair, we are dealing with a global pandemic, COVID-19. It is critically important that all countries in the world work together in a transparent, open and respectful manner so that we understand what is going on and how we can bring it to an end as quickly as possible. The Chair: The next question will come from Ms. Gallant."}

The Chair: The next question will come from Ms. Gallant. Mrs. Cheryl Gallant (RenfrewNipissingPembroke, CPC): Mr. Chair, if the government orders someone who has been exposed to a confirmed COVID case into a 14-day quarantine, why won't the government allow them to take an antibody test to lift the quarantine so they can go back to work? Hon. Patty Hajdu: As the member opposite may or may not know, testing strategies are determined by provinces and territories. Furthermore, the testing of a particular person has to be done at the right point in time The Chair: We go back to Ms. Gallant. Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Mr. Chair, there have already been some tests that have been approved. My friend and colleague here, Colin Carrie, from the constituency of Oshawa, has a constituent who has a test. It's 90% accurate and it's being sold to the United States and other countries. Why won't they provide a DIN number to it so that Canadians have access to it as well, regardless of which province or territory they live in? Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I think the member is talking about two separate things. Any test kit that would be approved by Health Canada would be accessible to wherever that company chose to market that test kit. Furthermore, it's really important that test kits that are approved by Health Canada be accurate and have been tested with rigour with regard to their ability to provide credible and accurate information to the people who are using that test. Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Mr. Chair, the test has proven to have an accuracy rate of 90% in identifying whether or not an individual has antibodies. Why won't she allow it to be used here? Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I am happy to follow up with the member opposite's office when she is able to provide me with the name of the company. As you can imagine, there are many vendors trying to The Chair: We go back to Ms. Gallant. Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: How long will it take for an antibody test to be approved by this government once you have the name of the company and the test and the evidence in front of you? The Chair: Before we go to the honourable minister, I just want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair and not directly. Go ahead, Minister. Hon. Patty Hajdu: We have an expedited process that could be completed in as little as five to seven days, depending on the accuracy of the test and the information supplied by the vendor. Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Through you, Mr. Chair, will Health Canada use reputable data from other countries to speed their determinations about antibody effectiveness, or just continue to withhold access? Hon. Patty Hajdu: Canadians expect us, at Health Canada, to ensure the accuracy and the safety of all equipment approved for use in Canada. Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Mr. Chairman, if the minister can approve tests and studies within five days, why is it taking over 30, over 60, or over 90 days to approve an antibody test that exists? Hon. Patty Hajdu: I appreciate the member opposite's interest in urgent and quick approvals; however, sometimes, depending on the company, there may be further questions and further tests that need to be run to ensure the accuracy or safety of that equipment. Should she wish me to check into the process for a particular The Chair: We will go back to Ms. Gallant. Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Have officials provided the government with a target for a daily antibody test to complete an initial survey or the initial phase of a study? Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I assume the member opposite is talking about the work of the immunity task force, which is, as you know, a group of scientists who have been funded by the Government of Canada The Chair: We'll go back to Ms. Gallant. Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Through you, Mr. Chair, would the minister please provide the names of the people on the task force to which she just referred? Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I will forward those names to the office of the member opposite. Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: I hope that will be within the next two days or so, and not wait until after the crisis has passed, Mr. Chairman. Why isn't the Prime Minister showing as much fervour for antibody testing as he is for getting a vaccine on the market? Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I reject the premise of that question. In fact, the Prime Minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage. To allege otherwise is quite disingenuous. The Chair: We'll go on to Mr. Kelly. Mr. Pat Kelly (Calgary Rocky Ridge, CPC): When will the government give the Auditor General the funds she needs to do her job? Hon. Steven Guilbeault (Minister of Canadian Heritage): First, Mr. Chair, I would like to offer my congratulations to the new Auditor General for her appointment. On behalf of the government, I would also like to offer her our full support and collaboration The Chair: We'll go to Mr. Kelly. Mr. Pat Kelly: I share the minister's wish to congratulate the new Auditor General on her position. I will now ask him again when he will give her the funds she needs to do her job. Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, her role is essential to our democracy. We are eager to work with her. She's more than welcome to share her concerns directly with the government. I can assure her that my The Chair: We'll go to Mr. Kelly. Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, I didn't ask him if he would like to work with the Auditor General. I asked him if he will give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job. Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, our government has added 38 permanent staff positions to her office, while the Conservative government, under their leadership, cut the funding for more than 60 The Chair: We'll move on to Mr. Kelly. Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, through you, I caution the minister to not mislead this House. If he will look at the committee transcripts of the time, he will know that it was the Auditor General's decision to reduce their own budget. The Conservatives did not cut positions. That is a matter of fact. The point is that the Auditor General now does not have the money to do her job. She has cut performance audits and she has stopped work on performance audits. When will this government give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job? Hon. Steven Guilbeault: With us, it was 38 new positions, Mr. Chair. With them, it was 60 positions fewer. Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, this government has drastically expanded its spending and is avoiding accountability in every way it can. The finance committee yesterday, with the support of Liberal backbench MPs who are on that committee, unanimously passed a motion to fund the Auditor General in full so that her office can do her job. If this minister will not listen to me, will he at least listen to his own backbenchers? Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, our government is fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the Auditor General, an independent officer of Parliament. If the Auditor General identifies the need for additional resources, we will work with the Office of the Auditor General to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue fulfilling their mandate efficiently and effectively. Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, the Auditor General has consistently, since 2018, told this government that the office doesn't have enough funds. It's not a mystery. The Auditor General has told the public accounts committee that it cannot do its job. It's the first time in history that the Auditor General has had to tell public accounts that they don't have the resources to do their job. It's not a matter of if the Auditor General needs more funds. The Auditor General couldn't be more clear. When will this government actually do the right thing and fully fund the Office of the Auditor General? Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, maybe I'm not making myself clear in English. I will switch to my native tongue, French, in case it becomes clearer. If the Auditor General identifies a need for additional resources, we will work with her to ensure that her office can continue to deliver its mandate efficiently and effectively. In addition, our government worked with the Auditor General to increase funding in 2018-09. With this increase, the office was able to add the equivalent of 38new full-time staff to its team. That's 38more employees The Chair: The floor goes to Mr.Kelly."}

It's always customary to give members a chance to correct the record, so I call upon the minister to do so now, and perhaps even the Prime Minister.

I have here the transcripts of the public accounts committee, and they will confirm that the The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): This is beginning to sound a bit like debate. We will proceed.

I would also like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague and friend, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. Obrigado. While Quebec estimates its additional health care costs related to COVID-19 at $3billion, Ottawa is transferring around $115million, which is not even4%. Does the government recognize that this is clearly insufficient? Hon. Patty Hajdu: Madam Chair, as the member opposite knows, we invested an initial $500 million in transfers to the provinces and territories to manage the extreme pressure put on health care systems as a result of their supporting people living with COVID and in preventing COVID. We want to thank the provinces and territories for their work, and as the member opposite knows, we will continue to be there for the provinces and territories. This is a significant transfer, and we think The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr.Ste-Marie, you have the floor. Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: MadamChair, the minister says that this is a substantial transfer. Yes, it is a lot of money. The government is giving about $115million to Quebec, but that is not even 4%of what is being requested. Does the minister recognize that much more is needed? Hon. Patty Hajdu: We have been working with the provinces and territories from the beginning to respond to the crisis. We have increased health care transfers, provided medical protective equipment and responded to all requests for assistance. We have been able to make so much progress in the fight against COVID-19 precisely because of this co-operation. Stirring up an imaginary quarrel between the federal government and Quebec The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr.Ste-Marie, you have the floor. Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: MadamChair, it isn't about squabbling, it's about needs. The share that the federal government is giving isn't enough. We should act now, before we see a possible second wave. What we're seeing today are the results of massive disinvestment by the federal government in health care. This isn't good enough. The government must act quickly. Can the government commit to better funding to the health care sector and to organizing a meeting with Quebec and the provinces on this exact topic, in September at the latest? We can't afford to wait. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The hon. minister's response will have to be brief. Hon. Patty Hajdu: Madam Chair, with respect to the transfers to provinces and territories, the member opposite knows that our government, in our last mandate, significantly increased transfers to the provinces and territories for health services, including mental health and home care services. In fact, the funding we're providing is in addition to the $40 billion that was transferred The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr.Brunelle-Duceppe. Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ): Thank you, MadamChair.   Tudo bem? Tudo bom?  Today in La Presse, we learned that the government has extended its military presence in long-term care homes. Can the minister confirm this information, and can he also confirm that the presence of these 500soldiers is indeed in response to a request from the Government of Quebec? Hon. Bill Blair: Madam Chair, let me assure the member that when Quebec made a request for assistance at the beginning of April, we answered the call. When they asked for an extension of that, we said we would continue to provide that assistance. I had a conversation today with Minister Guilbault, my counterpart in Quebec, and we have renewed our commitment to continuing to provide assistance. That assistance can take additional forms and can include involving the Canadian Red Cross, but we remain committed to providing the assistance that Quebec needs. Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe: If I understand correctly, negotiations are still under way with the Government of Quebec, even though it needs these soldiers. The mission ends Friday. This isn't really the time to negotiate anymore. We have to make sure that the military will stay in our long-term care homes as long as we need their services in Quebec, and until new attendants have been trained. Can the minister confirm that the mission will indeed be extended? Hon. Bill Blair: I'd like to assure this House that we have assured Quebec that the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to provide support until such time as other trained professional people are able to do that job. We're working very hard with the Province of Quebec. We're working with the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian Red Cross. We will be there for Quebeckers because they need our help, and as long as they need our help, we'll be there to support them. Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe: This isn't the time to play cat-and-mouse. The only thing we have to do is to give the Government of Quebec what it's asking for. Quebec pays 23%of the army's budget, so Quebeckers are entitled to this support. Quebec has more than 5,000deaths from COVID-19, 90%of which have been in seniors' residences or long-term care homes. The military's presence is vital because they play an extraordinary and essential role. Will the minister commit to extending the mission now and putting an end to this uncertainty? It's certainly bad for both the military and the health care workers, who rely on this support. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The hon. minister has 10seconds. Hon. Bill Blair: Again, Madam Chair, let me be very clear. We have made a commitment to the Province of Quebec that we will continue to provide that support until the middle of September, exactly as they have requested, but we are also working to ensure that we have an sustainable, effective solution to the request that Quebec has made, so we're working with the Province of Quebec, the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian Red Cross to ensure the help that is needed is there. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We will go now to Bryan May. Mr. Bryan May (Cambridge, Lib.): Thank you very much, Madam Chair. It's a pleasure and an honour to be with you all today. I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the member of Parliament for Scarborough North. Madam Chair, COVID-19 continues to create challenges for all Canadians, including those with disabilities, and exacerbates those experienced by Canadians with disabilities. As we mark the end of National AccessAbility Week, I would like to remind our colleagues that our commitment to making Canada more inclusive and equitable is ongoing, including our passing of the Accessible Canada Act. Would the minister inform the House about the government's plans to support Canadians with disabilities who are experiencing increased costs due to COVID-19? Hon. Carla Qualtrough (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion): Madam Chair, last week was the first National AccessAbility Week that was legislated under the historic Accessible Canada Act, and I thank every party in this House for the consent they gave to that legislation. I'm hoping we have the same spirit of camaraderie for people with disabilities this afternoon. Since the beginning, Madam Chair, we have taken a disability inclusion approach on how we support people with disabilities in this time of pandemic, including the establishment of our COVID-19 disability advisory group, which has given us invaluable advice. I thank them so much for their contributions to our efforts. Last week we announced a suite of measures to support people with disabilities that complement existing measures that are in place. This includes a one-time payment of $600 to 1.25 million citizens with disabilities, which again is the subject matter of the legislation this afternoon, as well as a $15-million investment in an accessible workplace initiative that will ensure, moving forward.... We know that as we move back into employment situations it will be very tough for people with disabilities. Finally, there are five really exciting accessible technology initiatives, including working on point-of-sale terminals for Canadians who are blind or visually impaired. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): You may have a very short question, Mr. May. Mr. Bryan May: I want to take this opportunity to thank the minister and her department for all the work they are doing to ensure that accessibility is at the forefront of everybody's mind through this crisis. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr. Chen is next. Mr. Shaun Chen (Scarborough North, Lib.): Madam Chair, as humanity battles COVID-19, we are confronted by the stark realities of another disease. On May 25, George Floyd fell unconscious and died as a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. This all happened after the 46-year-old black man was handcuffed and put in a position where he could do no harm. In Canada, we have come a long way since Viola Desmond, yet there is much more to do. Anti-black racism is institutionalized, hidden under dominant narratives of a free and multicultural society. Hatred has no boundaries, whether it is against black communities or is anti-Asian sentiment fuelled by COVID-19. The question always is this: Who is next? We must all stand up together against hatred and for justice and reconciliation, to dismantle systems of oppression that long remained unquestioned. Recent data from Statistics Canada shows that Canada is failing black youth, creating the conditions that push them into the justice system. To the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, my question is this: What is the government doing to address the unique challenges faced by black youth? Hon. Bardish Chagger (Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth): Madam Chair, the member for Scarborough North is absolutely correct. We must all do what we can to stand up against hatred and injustice. We often say that today's youth are not only the leaders of tomorrow but the leaders of today, so we need to equip them for success by investing in youth. According to the 2016 census, black Canadians accounted for 1.2 million people, and more than a quarter of that population is under the age of 15. Socio-economic gaps, such as in employment and education, exist between black and non-black youth. We need to do better. Our government has brought forward youth so they can inform the decisions we make. We have Canada's first youth policy, and it was created by youth for youth to ensure that all young people are equipped to live healthy and fulfilling lives, and are empowered to create positive change for themselves and their communities. Our government launched the community support for black Canadian youth program, which supported 56 projects geared to address the unique challenges faced by black Canadian youth through the development of leadership skills and civic engagement, while empowering them through the promotion of black history, culture and identity. To address the challenges of the pandemic, our government has implemented a suite of measures designed to help youth and students, including with employment and service opportunities. My office is working with community organizations who serve black youth to make sure they too are both aware of and benefiting from these measures. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Ms. Mathyssen is next. Ms. Lindsay Mathyssen (LondonFanshawe, NDP): Thank you, Madam Chair. I will be splitting my time with the member for TimminsJames Bay. Schools in many provinces remain closed, and many child care providers want to reopen. They must reduce their capacity due to COVID-19. Now more than ever we need universal, publicly funded child care to restart the economy. Will the government bring in legislation that would enshrine into law access to, and federal funding for, quality affordable child care? Hon. Ahmed Hussen (Minister of Families, Children and Social Development): Madam Chair, we are, of course, committed to investments in child care. We have constantly worked with provinces and territories to ensure that we provide the supports they need to provide quality, affordable and accessible child care. Since 2015, we have created over 40,000 child care spaces. We are committed to creating an additional 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces. Ms. Lindsay Mathyssen: The government doesn't seem to understand that this is not universal child care. During COVID-19, women have lost the majority of jobs, and they have taken on the majority of additional child care responsibilities. Canadian women want and need to return to work, but this government doesn't understand that without affordable child care, they simply cannot re-enter the workforce. For 26 years, Liberal governments have been promising, but failing to deliver, a universal child care program. Parents are paying the price. How much longer do parents have to wait? Hon. Ahmed Hussen: Madam Chair, I want to thank the honourable member for the important question. Since 2015, we have created 40,000 affordable, accessible, quality child care spaces across the country. We are on track to continue to invest $7.5 billion over 11 years to create additional child care spaces and support provinces and territories. We're constantly in touch with our counterparts to work to strengthen that sector. We are also keeping our promise and our commitment to create an additional 250,000 spaces. We will be there for parents as they get back to work, and we will continue to reinforce the early learning and child care sector. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): You have time for a very short question, Ms. Mathyssen. Ms. Lindsay Mathyssen: Without universal child care, we are crippling our economy. We are not providing an affordable system, and this stops women from returning to work. Instead of helping parents return to work, the government is now bringing forward legislation that's penalizing them. Why is the government looking to sentence mothers and fathers to jail time and large fines when they cannot find the child care that The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The honourable minister has time for a short answer. Hon. Ahmed Hussen: We are committed to the early learning and child care sector. We will move forward with the creation of an early learning and child care secretariat. We will continue to invest in this sector. We recognize its importance."}

We will continue to invest in this sector. We recognize its importance. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Now we will go to Mr. Angus. Mr. Charlie Angus (TimminsJames Bay, NDP): Thank you, Madam Chair. It's an honour to be here, and I'm hoping that you and your family stay safe at this time. COVID has shaken up Canada's middle class, so my question is for the Minister of Middle Class Prosperity. This morning I spoke with a businesswoman. She runs her own business, a travel agency, but because of COVID she has been wiped out. She's on CERB, and it's ticking down. There's no work to go back to, so in four weeks she hits the economic wall. Will the minister fight for an extension of CERB so this woman can stay in the middle class? Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, we know how worried Canadians are as they see their final four-week period of the CERB approaching, and we're working very hard to ensure that the CERB continues to serve an important purpose as we move into economic recovery. I'll note that when we created the CERB, there was a different purpose in mind. We were asking people to stay home. Now we're asking people to go back to work if it's safe for them to do so. We're going to make sure that the wage subsidy and the CERB complement each other. In fact, the measures in today's legislation will help us to get the flexibility to be able to do just that. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We did give you a little more time. We will go to Mr. Angus. Mr. Charlie Angus: Thank you for that. What I've seen with their legislation today is that they're talking about jailing people. We need a Minister of Middle Class Prosperity in a time of middle-class disparity, and she has talked about middle-class criminality. Let's talk about this again, about people going back to work. I spoke with a 51-year-old bartender. He's a professional; this is his job. There is no job to go back to. Will the minister assure us that this man will be able to stay in the middle class because the CERB will still be there in July, yes or no? Hon. Mona Fortier: MadamChair, since the beginning of the crisis, we've been helping Canadians by putting programs in place. We will continue to support families during the crisis, and afterwards as well. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr. Angus, you have time for a very short comment or question. Mr. Charlie Angus: The issue here is that when COVID hit, millions of Canadians were living in such precarious working conditions that they didn't even have enough money to pay their rent. That is a damning indictment. In four weeks, those Canadians are going to hit the economic wall again. What I need to know from the minister, and what Canadians need to know, is whether she will commit, yes or no, that the CERB will be there for those who have no work to go back to. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The honourable minister may give a very short answer. Hon. Mona Fortier: MadamChair, since the beginning of the crisis, we have been helping families with a supplement to the Canada child benefit. We have put in place the Canada emergency response benefit. We will continue to find ways to support Canadian families during this crisis. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We will go to Mr. Cooper. Mr. Michael Cooper (St. AlbertEdmonton, CPC): Thank you, Madam Chair. It was all the way back on March 25 that the Minister of Finance stated that help for the energy sector was coming within hours, possibly days. Well, as it turns out, it hasn't been hours. It hasn't been days. It hasn't even been weeks. Indeed, months later, help has yet to arrive. Seventy-seven days after the minister made that statement, not a single energy company has received financing under EDC, the BDC, or the LEEFF program. As the energy sector faces an unprecedented liquidity crisis, how can this government possibly justify such a delay? Hon. Seamus O'Regan (Minister of Natural Resources): Madam Chair, weeks ago we opened applications through the business credit availability program to support the small and medium-sized players that make up 85% of the jobs in our sector. We've also opened applications for measures that will be available to our larger players through our LEEFF program. We will continue to work with industry. We will continue to support workers, and we will continue to do so to get through this unprecedented challenge. Mr. Michael Cooper: Madam Chair, on June 2, the vice-president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said, The entire industry is frustrated with the delay that we are facing. The Saskatchewan Minister of Energy and Resources has spoken about a gaping hole that exists in terms of support for the energy sector. The gaping hole that I'm speaking of is the EDC and BDC programs that this government has failed to deliver upon. Indeed, it was on April 17 that those programs were announced, and 54 days later, not only has not a single energy company received financing, but guess what? They can't even apply, and the eligibility criteria have yet to be finalized after 54 days. If that is not failing to deliver for the energy sector, what is? Hon. Seamus O'Regan: Madam Chair, the Business Council of Alberta has said that the LEEFF program is a positive development showing that the federal government recognizes the needs and value of Canada's large corporations. We agree. It is essential that we support our oil and gas sector as it suffers through two crises: the impacts of COVID and the effects of a global price war initiated by Russia and Saudi Arabia. That's why, weeks ago, we opened applications for liquidity measures to support the small and medium-sized players that make up 85% of the jobs in our sector. We also announced liquidity made available to our larger players through the LEEFF program. We will continue to work with industry to make sure these programs are effective. Mr. Michael Cooper: Madam Chair, contrary to the representations of the minister, neither the EDC program nor BDC programs are accepting applications. Just yesterday officials from both BDC and EDC were before the finance committee, where I posed precisely those questions to them. We know, Madam Chair, that the application process isn't up and running and that eligibility criteria remain to be determined, but I guess this government has some good news for the energy sector after 77 days. Now energy sector companies can go on the BDC website and apply for email updates. Is that the kind of help the Minister of Finance had in mind after 77 days: email updates instead of real relief for the energy sector? Hon. Seamus O'Regan: Madam Chair, the Alberta finance minister, Travis Toews, said in a LEEFF announcement that in combination with earlier measures for small and medium-sized companies, it represented an expression of confidence in our industries. It is essential that we support our oil and gas sector as it suffers through these two crisesas I said, the impact of COVID, and then on top of that, the effect of a global price war. We opened up applications for liquidity measures as the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers asked. Their top five asks were all liquidity. We supported small and medium-sized players essential to the supply chain, who make up 85% of the jobs in that sector, and then we announced liquidity made available to our larger players through the LEEFF program. We will continue to work with industry and The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): I now have to interrupt for a few moments to allow our technicians to change places. With that done, Monsieur Martel, you may now go ahead.. Mr. Richard Martel (ChicoutimiLe Fjord, CPC): MadamChair, there has recently been positive progress in AndrGauthier's case, and I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Deputy Prime Minister for their co-operation in this matter. However, Mr.Gauthier is currently on his own in the United Arab Emirates, without a passport, waiting to settle civil lawsuits. What services does the minister intend to provide to help him, and when does he plan to repatriate AndrGauthier to Canada? Hon. Marc Garneau: MadamChair, in all cases similar to Mr.Gauthier's, the Government of Canada, through its consular services, tries to do the best it can under the circumstances. This file is still active. Mr. Richard Martel: The House recognized on February18, 2020, that the 15weeks of sickness benefits provided by employment insurance were insufficient. Citizens who became ill before March15 are now without help. They are being denied the CERB because they didn't lose their jobs because of COVID-19. They are being denied EI regular benefits because they are unable to work. In addition, some citizens are waiting for surgery, which is being delayed because of COVID-19. Is the government letting these people down? Hon. Carla Qualtrough: No, MadamChair, that's absolutely not the case. Of course, we understand that people who are no longer receiving EI benefits should have access to the CERB. We have committed to extending the emergency sickness benefit to 26weeks. We're working with everyone here to make that happen. We're taking into account the needs and circumstances of all citizens in our efforts to help Canadians. Mr. Richard Martel: I've called on the Minister of Economic Development several times to be more flexible in establishing these programs, so that they are better adapted to the realities of the regions. Recently, it was the SMEs in Montreal that were monopolizing the funds earmarked for the regions. When will the Liberal government listen to the needs of regions like SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean? Hon. Mlanie Joly: I thank my colleague for the opportunity to announce the good news that was mentioned on Radio-Canada this morning, namely, $71million more for the regions of Quebec. Of course, we're here for the regions. I will be happy to work with my colleague to ensure that the CFDC in his region can support businesses. We have to support businesses in SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean and across the country. Mr. Richard Martel: I think that's a canned speech. According to a survey conducted by the Universit de Trois-Rivires in Quebec, the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region is apparently the most economically affected by COVID-19. We have many projects, but they depend on the government's leadership to be carried out. Our region has forestry, the aluminum sector, GNL Qubec, tourism, the Port of Saguenay, Davie Canada, a military base and a tax centre. It's all here. We know we'll have to get the economy moving again soon. When will the government act to help our region? Hon. Mlanie Joly: Every day, we act to help my colleague's region. I've had good conversations with Promotion Saguenay. I've also spoken several times with various stakeholders in my colleague's beautiful region. We will always be there for them. I'd like to tell my colleague that there will be other announcements to support the economic development of the beautiful region of SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean. I will be happy to work with him to achieve good results. Mr. Richard Martel: Sustainable forestry development is at the heart of the economic development of Canada and for SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean. Canadians have reason to be proud of the use of the boreal forest in the fight against climate change. Currently, our innovative forest industry is experiencing many problems, and on top of that, there is the COVID-19 crisis. Who will defend our forestry workers? Hon. Mlanie Joly: Of course, we believe in the importance of regional economic development. That's why we're always there to defend our forestry workers. I will also be pleased to work with my colleague, the Minister of Natural Resources, who is very familiar with the matter and who knows the challenges faced by the various businesses in the forestry sector, as well as the employees. We will always be there to support employees and create more jobs across Quebec and the country. The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Ms. Sahota is next. Go ahead, please. Ms. Jag Sahota (Calgary Skyview, CPC): Thank you, Madam Chair. We continue to see significant gaps in the Liberals' programs. There are still people who are falling through the cracks and being left behind. We are hearing from women who are pregnant or who have just given birth and are being left out or told to go back to work. When will this government stop letting Canadians down? Hon. Carla Qualtrough: We know that there are many situations of Canadians who are about to or are just going on maternity or parental benefits who might not have access to their EI benefits due to not having accumulated enough time for COVID reasons. We're working very hard to make sure, as we did for fish harvesters, that we support all Canadians in these situations. I look forward to advising Canadians of our approach on this very soon. Ms. Jag Sahota: Madam Chair, that simply isn't good enough. This is something that has been brought to the government's attention for months now, and still nothing has been done. These families deserve answers now. Had the government conducted a GBA+ analysis, they would have discovered this prior to rolling out inadequate programs for women. Why wasn't a GBA+ conducted? Hon. Carla Qualtrough: I can assure everyone in this House that we are very aware and deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of this pandemic on women and girls. We are working hard to ensure that everyone has the supports they need. As we move forward, we are, as I said earlier, taking into consideration improvements to the EI system, the wage subsidy and the future of CERB. All these play together as we work to provide a comprehensive forward-looking support package for Canadians. Ms. Jag Sahota: Madam Chair, might I remind my honourable colleague that this Prime Minister said that every piece of legislation would go through a rigorous GBA+? Why was it not done? Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, I can assure the member that we absolutely took into account the needs of women as we developed the CERB. I can tell you that women are benefiting significantly from this benefit."}

So we 're gonna set up features along the lines of where they want to go and  what they 've said previously and whatnot . And then we have  the means  that they should use . Right ? but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist  or  whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines . Or  Yes , we could things we couldn't extract the  from the data , the hidden variables . Yes , good . So then the hidden variables  hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , because we were thinking uh , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to  like  or th Grad C: Want to do Vista , Grad C: right ? Because  if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry . Grad B: Or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a  like a  navigational point to go to another place . Grad B: But we just decided to keep all the things we extracted  to point at the middle and then  down . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Why is the landmark  OK . The landmark is facing to the tourists . That 's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not as possible um Grad B: Right . Grad C: Yeah . Grad B: Navigational landmarks , Grad D: Navigational cue . Grad A: navigational landmarks Grad B: yeah . Grad A: so Mm - hmm . Then Grad B: Yeah , that would be  whatever building they referred to . Grad D: Prosody . Grad C: Right . So let 's see . The variables . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad C: Disc - \" admission fee \" is a binary thing , \" time of day \" is like morning , afternoon , night . Is that the deal ? Yeah . Grad B: That 's how we have it currently set up , Grad A: Yep . Grad B: but it could be ,  you know , based upon hour Grad C: Yeah . Yeah . Grad A: Whatever granularity . Grad B: or  dis we could discrete it  des descret - ize it . Grad C: Yeah . Grad A: Uh - huh . Grad C: Yeah . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad C: Yeah . Normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular  part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , I guess . Grad A: Yep . Grad D: OK . So that 's given in their input . Grad B: Right . Grad C: So  Right , Grad D: Right ? Grad C: so it 's not really all of context . Similarly prosody is not all of prosody but simply  for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed . Grad A: Mm - hmm . that 's very nice , huh ? Grad D: OK . Grad A: The  the  So the context is a switch between tourist or non - tourist ? Grad C: and Grad A: Or also unknown ? Grad B: Or un  unknown , Grad A: OK . Grad B: yeah . Grad C: Yeah . Unknown , right ? Grad D: So final dest So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist , Grad C: Which is th Which one ? Grad D: but OK . so the the context being um , e I don't know if that question 's sort of in general , \" are you  \" I mean the  ar ar are do they allow business people to be doing non - business things at the moment ? Grad C: Yeah , it does . Grad D: OK . So then you just have some probabilities over Grad C: Everything is probablistic , and  There 's always Grad D: OK .  over which which of those it is . Grad C: Yeah . Um , right . So then landmark is  Oh , sorry . \" Verb used \" is like , right now we only have three values , but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad C: Rather , let me rephrase that . It  it can take values  in the set of all verbs , that they could possibly use . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad C: Um \" nice walls \" is binary , \" closed \" is binary \" final destination \" , again  Yeah , all those are binary I guess . And \" mode \" is one of three things . Grad A: So , the  the middle layer is also binary ? No . Grad C: Yeah , anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node . Grad A: Uh . It  Yeah . But all those things without question marks are also binary . Right ? Grad C: Which things ? Grad A: Nice walls ? Grad B: Wi Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad C: Oh . \" Nice walls \" is uh  something that we extract from our world knowledge . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad C: Yeah , a Oh yeah . Sorry . It is binary . Grad B: It is binary but it doesn't have question mark because it 's extracted . Grad C: That 's true . Yeah . OK , I see your point . Grad A: Yeah . OK . Grad B: Yeah . Grad A: I  I gotcha . Grad D: Uh - huh . Grad C: Yeah , similarly \" closed \" , I guess . Grad A: So we can either be in a hurry or not , but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment ? Grad C: Well , we To do that we would add another uh  value for that . Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK . Grad C: And that would require s updating the probability distribution for \" mode \" as well . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad C: Because it would now have to like uh  take that possibility into account . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Take a conti Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad D: So um , of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases Grad A: Yeah , yeah . Grad C: Yeah . Grad D: but you can imagine that it 's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would  that would help you  Like it 's a conjunction of , I don't know , you know , the verb used and some other stuff that  that would   determine Grad C: Right . Other syntactic information you mean ? Grad D: Yeah . Exactly . Grad C: Yeah . Grad D: Um . Grad A: well the  the  sort of the landmark is  is sort of the object right ? the argument in a sense ? Grad D: Usually . I  I don't know if that 's always the case I  I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have . So . Um . Grad A: that 's always warping on something  some entity , Grad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Grad A: and um  Uh maybe at this stage we will  we do want to  uh sort of get  uh modifiers in there Grad B: Hmm . Yeah . Grad A: because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not Grad B: I want to get to the church quickly , Grad C: Yeah . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad B: and uh Grad C: Yeah , right . Grad D: That would be a cue . Grad A: what 's the fastest way Grad C: Yeah , correct . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Um . OK . Grad B: Right . Excellent . Do we have anything else to say about this ? Grad C: We can do a little demo . Grad B: Oh the Yeah , we could . But the demo doesn't work very well . Grad A: No , then it wouldn't be a demo I was just gonna s Grad C: I mean  We can do a demo in the sense that we can um ,  just ob observe the fact that this will , in fact do inference . Grad B: Observe nodes . Grad C: So we can , you know , set some of the uh nodes and then try to find the probability of other nodes . Grad D: Yeah . Go ahead . Grad B: OK . Dat - dat - dah . What should I observe ? Grad C: Just se set a few of them . You don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time . Just like uh ,  maybe the fact that they use a certain verb Grad B: OK . Grad C: Actually forget the verb . Grad B: OK . Grad C: just uh  I don't know , say they discussed the admission fee Grad B: OK . Grad C: and uh   the place has nice walls Grad B: I love nice walls , OK ? I 'm a big fan . Grad C: and it 's night . Grad D: it 's starting to grow on me Grad B: And the time of day is night ? Grad C: Yeah , no wait . That  that doesn't uh  it 's not really consistent . They don't discuss the admission fee . Make that false . Grad B: Alright . Grad C: And it 's night . Grad B: Oh , they  OK . Oh whoops . I forgot to uh Grad C: That didn't work . Grad B: Ach ! Grad D: I 'd like to do that again . Grad B: One thing that bugs me about JavaBayes is you have to click that and do this . Grad D: Yeah . That seems kind of redundant but . Grad C: OK . Grad B: That all you want ? Grad C: Yes . Grad B: OK . So let 's see . I want  to query , Grad C: \" Go \" and , right , \" query \" . Grad B: right ? the mode . OK , and then on here  So let 's see . Grad C: So that  is the probability that they 're Entering , Vista - ing or Tango - ing . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad B: Yeah . Grad C: And uh Grad D: So slightly  biased  toward \" Tango \" ing Grad C: Yeah . Grad B: If it 's night time ,  they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice . Grad D: OK . Grad B: So , yeah . I guess that  sort of makes sense . The reason I say the  demo doesn't work very well is yesterday we uh   observed everything in favor of  taking a tour , and it came up as \" Tango \" , right ? Over and over again . We couldn't  we couldn't figure out how to turn it off of \" Tango \" ."}

Grad A: No , then it wouldn't be a demo I was just gonna s Grad C: I mean  We can do a demo in the sense that we can um ,  just ob observe the fact that this will , in fact do inference . Grad B: Observe nodes . Grad C: So we can , you know , set some of the uh nodes and then try to find the probability of other nodes . Grad D: Yeah . Go ahead . Grad B: OK . Dat - dat - dah . What should I observe ? Grad C: Just se set a few of them . You don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time . Just like uh ,  maybe the fact that they use a certain verb Grad B: OK . Grad C: Actually forget the verb . Grad B: OK . Grad C: just uh  I don't know , say they discussed the admission fee Grad B: OK . Grad C: and uh   the place has nice walls Grad B: I love nice walls , OK ? I 'm a big fan . Grad C: and it 's night . Grad D: it 's starting to grow on me Grad B: And the time of day is night ? Grad C: Yeah , no wait . That  that doesn't uh  it 's not really consistent . They don't discuss the admission fee . Make that false . Grad B: Alright . Grad C: And it 's night . Grad B: Oh , they  OK . Oh whoops . I forgot to uh Grad C: That didn't work . Grad B: Ach ! Grad D: I 'd like to do that again . Grad B: One thing that bugs me about JavaBayes is you have to click that and do this . Grad D: Yeah . That seems kind of redundant but . Grad C: OK . Grad B: That all you want ? Grad C: Yes . Grad B: OK . So let 's see . I want  to query , Grad C: \" Go \" and , right , \" query \" . Grad B: right ? the mode . OK , and then on here  So let 's see . Grad C: So that  is the probability that they 're Entering , Vista - ing or Tango - ing . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad B: Yeah . Grad C: And uh Grad D: So slightly  biased  toward \" Tango \" ing Grad C: Yeah . Grad B: If it 's night time ,  they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice . Grad D: OK . Grad B: So , yeah . I guess that  sort of makes sense . The reason I say the  demo doesn't work very well is yesterday we uh   observed everything in favor of  taking a tour , and it came up as \" Tango \" , right ? Over and over again . We couldn't  we couldn't figure out how to turn it off of \" Tango \" . Grad D: So . Uh - huh . Grad C: It loves the Tango . Grad D: Huh ! Um . Grad C: Well , that 's obviously just to do with our probabilities . Grad B: Yeah , yeah . Grad C: Like ,  we totally hand - tuned the probabilities , Grad D: Yeah . Grad C: right . We were like  \" hmm , well if the person does this and this and this , let 's say forty percent for this , Grad D: OK . Grad C: fifty per \" Like , you know . So obviously that 's gonna happen . Grad B: Yeah . Grad D: Right . Grad A: Yeah but it  it Grad D: Maybe the bias toward \" Tango \" ing was yours , then ? Grad B: Yeah , Grad C: Yeah . Grad B: that 's  that 's at Grad C: It 's  So we have to like fit the probabilities . Grad B: Spent my youth practicing the tango de la muerte . Grad D: So , the real case ? Grad A: However you know , it  The purpose was not really , at this stage , to come up with meaningful probabilities but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer . And so th Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: And Grad B: We would actually  I guess once we look at the data more we 'll get more hidden  nodes , Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad C: Yeah . Grad B: but I 'd like to see more . Not because it would  expedite the probabilities , cuz it wouldn't . It would actually slow that down tremendously . Grad C: Um . Well , yeah , I guess . Grad B: But . Grad C: Not that much though . Only a little early . Grad B: No , I think we should have uh  exponentially more  middle nodes than features we 've extracted . I 'm ju I 'm just jo Grad C: OK . Grad D: So . Are \" doing business \" versus \" tourist \"  They refer to your current task . Like  like current thing you want to do at this moment . Grad C: Um . Yeah , well   That 's  that 's an interesting point . Whether you 're  It 's whether  It 's not Grad D: And are th Grad C: I think it 's more like \" Are you are tourist ? are you in Ham - like Heidelberg for a  \" Grad D: Oh , so , I thought that was directly given by the context  switch . Grad C: That 's a different thing . What if the context , which is not set , but still they say things like , \" I want to go  uh , see the uh  the  the castle and uh , et cetera . \" Grad A: Is it Grad B: Well the I kind of  thought of \" doing business \" as more of running an errand type thing . Grad C: Yeah . Business on the other hand is , uh , definitely what you 're doing . Grad A: So if you run out of cash as a tourist , and  and  and you need to go to the AT Grad B: So  i wi th Grad D: OK . Oh , I see , you may have a task . wh you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage . Grad A: Mmm . Grad B: Right . Grad C: Yeah . Grad A: \" How do I get to the bank ? \" Grad D: I see . Hmm . Grad C: And that 'll affect whether you want to enter or you if you  kinda thing . Grad D: OK . So the \" tourists \" node  should be  um , very consistent with the context node . Right ? If you say that 's more their  in general what their background is . Grad C: Yeah , I think this context node is a bit of a  I don't know , like in d Uh  Do we  wanna have  Like it 's Grad D: Are you assuming that or not ? Like is that to be  I mean if that 's accurate then that would determine tourist node . Grad C: If the context were to set one way or another , that like strongly uh um , says something about whether  whether or not they 're tourists . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad C: So what 's interesting is when it 's not  when it 's set to \" unknown \" . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Grad A: We - what set the  they set the context to \" unknown \" ? Grad D: OK . Grad B: OK . Grad C: Right now we haven't observed it , so I guess it 's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad B: Right . Grad C: But yes , you can set it to un \" unknown \" . Grad A: And if we now do  leave everything else as is the results should be the same , Grad B: Oops . Grad A: right ? Grad B: No . Grad C: Well no , because we  Th - the way we set the probabilities  might not have  Yeah , it 's  it 's an  it 's an issue , right ? Like Grad A: Pretty much the same ? Grad C: Yeah , it is . So the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then \" unknown \" as an actual value . What 's common is you just like don't observe the variable , Grad D: Yeah . Grad A: Yep . Grad C: right , and then just marginalizes Grad D: Yeah . Grad C: But uh   We didn't do this because we felt that there 'd  I guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually Grad B: We were thi Yeah , Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad B: We were th Grad C: But uh  I don't know y what the right thing is to do for that . I 'm not  I don't know if I totally am happy with  the way it is . Grad A: Why don't we  Can we , um  How long would it take to  to add another  node on the observatory and , um , play around with it ? Grad C: Another node on what ? Grad B: Uh , well it depends on how many things it 's linked to . Grad A: Let 's just say make it really simple . If we create  something that for example would be um  So th some things can be landmarks in your sense but  they  can never be entered ? So for example s a statue . Grad C: Good point . Grad A: Yeah ? Grad B: Right . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: So  maybe we wanna have \" landmark \"  meaning now \" enterable landmark \" versus , um something that 's simply just a vista point , for example . Grad B: Yeah , that 's true . Grad A: Yeah ? uh , a statue or um Grad C: So basically it 's addressing a variable that 's \" enterable or not \" . So like an \" enterable , question mark \" . Grad B: Also   you know , didn't we have a  size as one ? The size of the landmark . Grad C: What ? Grad B: Cuz if it 's Grad C: Um . Not when we were doing this , Grad B: Yeah . Grad C: but I guess at some point we did . Grad B: For some reason I had that  OK , that was a thought that I had at one point but then went away . Grad C: So you want to have a  a node for like whether or not it can be entered ? Grad A: Well , for example , if we include that , yeah ? Grad C: Yeah . Grad A: um , accessibility or something , yeah ? \" Is it  Can it be entered ? \" Grad C: Hmm . Grad A: then of course , this is  sort of binary as well . Grad C: Yeah .

Grad C: it 's not Grad B: We were doing it Grad C: Yeah we can maybe write an interface th for uh entering probability distributions easily , something like  like a little script . That might  be worth it . Grad A: And that might do . Grad D: Yeah . I actually seem to recall Srini complaining about something to do with Entering probability so this is probably Grad C: The other thing is it is in Java Grad D: Yeah , it 's  Yeah . Grad C: so . Grad B: We could  manipulate the source  itself ? Grad D: Yeah . Grad B: Or Grad A: Do you have the true source files or just the class ? Grad B: I don't know if he actually Grad C: Yeah . Uh , yeah . we do Grad B: Does he Grad C: I  I saw directory called \" source \" , Grad B: Oh . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad B: I didn't e Grad C: or  Yeah . Go up one ? Grad B: Up one . Ah yes , good . Grad C: Yeah . Grad B: \" Source \" . That 's  that 's quite nice . Grad C: I don't know if it actually manipulate the source , though . That might be a bit complicated . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad C: I think it might  it might be simpler to just  have a script that , you know  It 's , like , friendly , Grad D: The d the data tables . Grad C: it allows you enter things well . Grad D: Yeah . Grad B: Right . Grad A: But if th if there is an XML  file that  or format that it can also read  I mean it just reads this , right ? When it starts . Grad C: Mm - hmm . Grad B: Yeah I know there is an  I was looking on the we web page and he 's updated it for an XML version of I guess Bayes - nets . There 's a Bayes - net spec for  in XML . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad C: He 's  Like this guy has ? Grad B: Yeah . Grad C: The JavaBayes guy ? So  but , e he doesn't use it . So in what sense has he updated it ? Grad B: Well th you can either  you ca or you can read both . Grad C: Oh . I see . Grad B: To my understanding . Grad C: OK . That would be awesome . Grad D: Oh . Grad B: Because uh  Well at least the  uh  I could have misread the web page , I have a habit of doing that , but . Grad A: OK , wonderful . Grad C: OK . Grad A: So you got more slides ? Grad B: Do I have more slides ? Um yes , one more . \" Future Work \" . I think every presentation have a should have a \" Future Work \" slide . But uh it 's basically  we already talked about all this stuff , so . Grad C: Um . The additional thing is I guess learning the probabilities ,  also . E That 's maybe , I don't know   If Grad B: Uh that 's future future work . Grad C: Does  That 's  Yeah . Grad B: Right . Grad C: Very future . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad B: And of course if you have a presentation that doesn't  have something that doesn't work at all , then you have \" What I learned \" , as a slide . Grad D: Can't you have both ? Grad B: You could . My first approach failed . Grad D: Right . Grad B: What I learned . OK , so I think that uh our presentation 's finished . Grad A: Good . Grad B: I know what I like about these meetings is one person will nod , and then the next person will nod , and then it just goes all the way around the room . Grad A: So the uh Grad D: I missed my turn . Grad B: No I  Earlier I went  and Bhaskara went  and you did it . You did it . Grad A: It 's like yawning . Grad D: It 's like yawning . Grad A: And this announcement was in stereo . Grad C: Ha . Grad A: OK . So this means um Grad B: Should I pull up the  net again ? Grad D: Yeah . Could you put the  the um , net up again ? Grad B: Yes . There we go . Grad D: Thanks . Grad B: And actually I was  cuz I got a wireless mike on . Grad D: So a more general thing than \" discussed admission fee \" um , could be  I  I 'm just wondering whether the context , the background context of the discourse  might be  I don't know , if there 's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way um , there might be other cues that , say , um , in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes uh , I don't know if that might be Grad A: Mm - hmm . I think we Grad D: uh , and  and into that node would be various  various things that  that could have specifically come up . Grad A: I think a  a sort of general strategy here  You know , this is  this is excellent because  um it gets you thinking along these terms  is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Right . Grad A: And um  let 's make those four . And maybe there are two um  So maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net ,  which has two   has it 's own middle layer . Maybe this , you know , has some  kind  of um , funky thing that di if this and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something that is uh , a more general version of the actual  phenomenon that you can observe . So things that point towards Grad B: So instead of single node , for  like , if they said the word \" admission fee \" Grad D: Exactly . Grad B: \" admission fee \" , or maybe , you know , \" how much to enter \" Grad D: Yeah . Grad B: or you know something , other cues . Grad D: Opening hours or something like that . Grad B: Exactly . That would all f funnel into one node that would  constitute entrance requirements or something like that . Grad A: So \" pay a visit \" Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: uh uh d Grad C: Sure . Grad A: Yeah ? Grad C: Yeah . Grad D: I mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse . I mean that 's like the bigger um , version of it . Grad A: Exactly . Yeah ? And then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before , um it 's more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a  in a  in a route um , sort of proceeding past these things , so this would be just something that  where you want to pass it . Hmm ? Is that it ? However these are of course then the  the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer . So this  again points to \" final destination \" , \" doing business \" , \" tourist hurry \" and so forth . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad B: OK . Grad A: Yeah ? And so then we can say , \" OK . we have a whole  region  \"  in a e Grad D: That 's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer . Grad A: Yeah , exactly . And this is just  then just one . Grad D: Right ? Grad A: So e because at the end the more we um  add , you know , the more spider - web - ish it 's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing . It 's going to get very ugly . But with this way we could say \" OK , these are the  discourse phenomena . They ra may have there own hidden layer  that points to some of  the  the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer . Grad C: Sure . Grad A: And the same we will be able to do for syntactic information , the verbs used , the object types used , modifiers . And maybe there 's a hidden layer for that . Grad C: Yep . Grad A: And so forth and so forth . Then we have context . Grad C: Yeah . So essentially a lot of those nodes can be expanded into little Bayes - nets of their own . Grad A: Yep .

Grad C: Yeah . Grad B: I mean , it makes it cleaner , but then uh  I mean . Grad C: That 's true . Grad B: For instance if the discourse does Grad D: What do you mean by that ? Grad B: well for instance , the \" discourse admission fee \"  node seems like it should point directly to the Grad D: Uh - huh . Grad B: or increase the probability of \" enter  directly \" versus \" going there via tourist \" . Grad C: Yeah . Or we could like add more , uh , sort of middle nodes . Like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad B: Right . Grad C: So it 's like  There are  Those are the two options . Either like make an arrow directly or put a new node . Grad B: Yeah , Grad D: Hmm . Grad B: that makes sense . Grad A: Yeah . And if it  if you do it  If you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that  like \" So how much has it cost to enter ? \" and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars , and then the persons says um \" Yeah I want to see it . \" Yeah ? meaning \" It 's way out of my budget \" um Grad B: There are places in Germany where it costs two hundred fifty dollars to enter ? Grad A: Um , nothing comes to mind . Without thinking too hard . Um , maybe , yeah of course , um opera premiers . Grad B: Really ? Grad A: So you know . Grad D: Hmm . Grad A: Or  or any good old Pink Floyd concert . Grad B: I see . If you want to see \" The Magic Flute \" or something . Grad A: Yeah . Grad D: Or maybe um , a famous restaurant . or , I don't know . There are various things that you might w not want to eat a  meal there but  your own table . Grad B: The Spagos of Heidelberg . Grad A: I think that the h I mean nothing beats the  the admission charge prices in Japan . So there , two hundred dollars is  is moderate for getting into a discotheque . You know . Then again , everything else is free then once you 're ins in there . Grad C: Really . Grad A: Food and drink and so forth . So . I mean . But i you know , i we can  Something  Somebody can have discussed the admission fee and u the answer  is s if we  um , you know , um  still , based on that result is never going to enter that building . Grad B: Hmm . Grad A: You know ? Because it 's just too expensive . Grad B: Oh yeah , I think I see . So the discourse refers to \" admission fee \" but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse . Grad D: Yeah . you have to have some notion of not just  I mean there 's a  there 's change across several turns of discourse Grad B: Right . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad D: so  I don't know how  if any of this was discussed  but how i if it all this is going to interact with  whatever general  uh , other  other discourse processing that might be happen . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad C: Yeah .   Yeah . Grad D: I mean . Grad B: What sort of discourse  processing is uh  are the  How much is built into SmartKom and Grad A: It works like this . The uh , um  I mean . The first thing we get is that  already the intention is sort of t They tried to figure out the intention , right ? simply by parsing it . And this um  m won't differentiate between all modes , yeah ? but at least it 'll tell us \" OK here we have something that  somebody that wants to go someplace , now it 's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is  is   is happening , and um , if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything  all the information is needed , what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is , um o one of the most elaborate  elaborate modules . It 's  it 's actually the  the whole memory of the entire system , that knows what  wh who said what , which was  what was presented . It helps an an anaphora resolution and it  and it fills in all the structures that are omitted , so ,  um , because you say \" OK ,  how can I get to the castle ? \" Oh , how  how much is it ? \" and um \" yeah I would like uh  um  to g let 's do it \" and so forth . So even without an a ana  anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here . Grad B: Mm - hmm . Grad A: Because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened . so  whenever the uh , um person is not actually rejecting what happened before , so as in \" No I really don't want to see that movie . I 'd rather stay home and watch TV \" um  What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is  is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step , by the discourse model  discourse  model , Yeah , that 's what it 's called . and , um , it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues . So a person pointing to something on the screen , you know , the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen Grad B: Hmm . Grad A: so it 's a  it 's a rather huge   huge thing but um    um    we can  sort of  It has a very clear interface . We can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and  and the turn before that or you know how  deep we want to search Grad B: OK . Grad A: um  which is a question . How deep do we want to sear , you know ? Um  but we should  try to keep in mind that , you know , we 're doing this sort of for research , so we  we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to Adam and Eve . You know , did that person ever discuss admissions fee  fees in his entire life ? And the dialogues are pretty  pretty you know  concise and  Anyway . Grad D: So one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the  use of \" admission fee discussion \" as a cue for entry ,   is thinking about the plans that various people might have . Like all the different  sort of general schemas that they might be following OK . This person is um , finding out information about this thing in order to go  in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place  in order to do business . Um , because then  anything that 's a cue for one of the steps  would be slight evidence for that overall plan . Um , I don't know . They 're  in  in non in sort of more traditional AI kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have   you know , some idea at each turn of agent doing something , \" OK , wha what plans is this a  consistent with ? \" and then get s some more information and then you see  \" here 's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into \" . It  it might be useful here too . Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad D: I  I don't know how you know you 'd have to   figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that . Grad A: I mean the   u u Grad B: Hmm . Grad A: It 's in the  these  these  these plan schemas . I mean there are some  some of them are extremely elaborate , you know . \" What do you need  need to buy a ticket ? \" Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: You know ? and it  it 's fifty steps , Grad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Grad A: huh ? just for buying a ticket  at a ticket counter , you know , and  and maybe that 's helpful to look at it  to look at those . It 's amazing what human beings can do . W when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh  a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says  New York and you say Track seven , huh ? And it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know  You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than \" New York \" , huh ? inferring everything from the context . So , works . Um , even though there is probably no train from here to New York , right ? Grad D: Mmm . Not direct . Grad B: You 'd uh probably have to transfer in Chicago . Grad A: Mm - hmm . But uh  it 's possible . Um , no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else . Right ? Is that t San Francisco , Chicago ? Grad B: I think Grad A: Is that possible ? Grad B: One time I saw a report on trains , and I think there is a l I don't know if  I thought there was a line that went from somewhere , maybe it was Sacramento to Chicago , Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad B: but there was like a California to Chicago line of some sort . Grad A: Hmm . Grad B: I could be wrong though . It was a while ago . Grad D: The Transcontinental Railroad , doesn't that ring a bell ? Grad B: Yeah but I don't know if it 's still Grad D: I think it has to exist somewhere . Grad B: They might have blown it up . Grad A: Well it never went all the way , right ? I mean you always had to change trains at Omaha , Grad D: Well most of the way . Grad A: right ? One track ended there and the other one started at  five meters away from that Grad D: Uh . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Grad A: and  sort of Grad D: Well .  You seem to know better than we do so . Grad A: yeah ? Has anybody ever been on an Amtrak ? Grad D: I have . But not transcontinentally . Grad B: I 'm frightened by Amtrak myself . Grad C: What ? Why ? Grad B: I just  They seem to have a lot of accidents on the Amtrak . Grad C: Really ? Grad A: Their reputation is very bad . Grad B: Yeah . Yeah . Grad A: huh ? It 's not maybe reality . Grad D: It 's not like German trains . Like German trains are really great so . Grad A: But  you know , I don't know whether it 's  which ones are safer , you know , statistically . Grad D: Um , but they 're faster . Grad C: Yeah . Grad A: Much faster . Mm - hmm . Grad C: And there 's much more of them . Yeah , they 're Yeah , it 's  way better Grad A: yeah I used  um Amtrak quite a bit on the east coast and I was surprised . It was actually OK . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: You know , on Boston New York , Grad D: Yeah . Grad A: New York Rhode Island , Grad C: Yeah . Grad A: whatever , Grad C: I 've done that kind of thing . Grad A: Boston . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: Yeah . But  That 's  a different issue . Grad B: This is going to be an interesting transcript . Grad A: Hmm ? Grad C: I  I want to see what it does with uh \" landmark - iness \" . That 's Grad B: Yeah . Grad D: Let 's all say it a few more times . Grad B: It 'd help it figure it out . Grad C: So . Grad D: Just kidding . Right . Grad C: Yeah . Grad D: So by the way tha that structure  that Robert drew on the board was like more um ,   cue - type - based , right , here 's like we 're gonna  segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse and then  some of the things we 're talking about here are more  you know , we mentioned maybe  if they talk about  um , I don't know , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based . Grad B: Hmm . Grad D: So I  I don't know if there  There 's obviously some  m more than one way of organizing  the variables into something Grad A: I think that um  What you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks , and maybe some of their conditions . Grad D: so . Mm - hmm . Grad A: One task is more likely you 're in a hurry when you do that kind of s doing business , Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: and  and less in a hurry when uh  you 're a tourist Um   tourists may have  never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around so  maybe what  what  what happened  what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: and then we 'll get these sub - middle layers , that are more cue - based . Grad D: Mm - hmm . That feed into those ? Grad A: Nah ? Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: Might be  might be a nice dichotomy of  of the world . So , um I suggest w to  for  to proceed with this in  in the sense that  maybe throughout this week the three of us will  will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions , and we make up some   some toy a observable \" nodes \"  is that what th Grad B: Refined y re just refine the"}

Grad A: Much faster . Mm - hmm . Grad C: And there 's much more of them . Yeah , they 're Yeah , it 's  way better Grad A: yeah I used  um Amtrak quite a bit on the east coast and I was surprised . It was actually OK . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: You know , on Boston New York , Grad D: Yeah . Grad A: New York Rhode Island , Grad C: Yeah . Grad A: whatever , Grad C: I 've done that kind of thing . Grad A: Boston . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: Yeah . But  That 's  a different issue . Grad B: This is going to be an interesting transcript . Grad A: Hmm ? Grad C: I  I want to see what it does with uh \" landmark - iness \" . That 's Grad B: Yeah . Grad D: Let 's all say it a few more times . Grad B: It 'd help it figure it out . Grad C: So . Grad D: Just kidding . Right . Grad C: Yeah . Grad D: So by the way tha that structure  that Robert drew on the board was like more um ,   cue - type - based , right , here 's like we 're gonna  segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse and then  some of the things we 're talking about here are more  you know , we mentioned maybe  if they talk about  um , I don't know , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based . Grad B: Hmm . Grad D: So I  I don't know if there  There 's obviously some  m more than one way of organizing  the variables into something Grad A: I think that um  What you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks , and maybe some of their conditions . Grad D: so . Mm - hmm . Grad A: One task is more likely you 're in a hurry when you do that kind of s doing business , Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: and  and less in a hurry when uh  you 're a tourist Um   tourists may have  never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around so  maybe what  what  what happened  what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: and then we 'll get these sub - middle layers , that are more cue - based . Grad D: Mm - hmm . That feed into those ? Grad A: Nah ? Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: Might be  might be a nice dichotomy of  of the world . So , um I suggest w to  for  to proceed with this in  in the sense that  maybe throughout this week the three of us will  will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions , and we make up some   some toy a observable \" nodes \"  is that what th Grad B: Refined y re just refine the Grad A: What 's the technical term ? Grad C: OK . For which ? Grad A: For the uh  nodes that are observable ? The \" outer layer \" ? Grad C: Just observable nodes , Grad B: The features , Grad C: evidence nodes ? Grad B: I don't know , whatever you Grad A: Feature ma make up some features for those  Identify  four regions , Grad C: Yeah . Grad A: maybe make up some features for each region and uh   and uh , uh  and uh  middle layer for those . And then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space Grad C: Yeah . Grad B: Basically just refine  some of the more general nodes . Grad A: Yep . The - they  they will be aud ad - hoc for  for  for some time to come . Grad C: Yeah , this is totally like  The probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc . We need to look at all of them . I mean but , they 're even like   I mean like , close to the end we were like , uh , you know we were like uh  really ad - hoc . Grad D: It 's a even distribution . Like , whatever . Grad C: Right ? Cuz if it 's like , uh  If it 's four things coming in , right ? And , say , some of them have like three possibilities and all that . So you 're thinking like  like a hundred and forty four or something  possible things  numbers to enter , Grad D: And  That 's terrible . Grad C: right ? So . Grad B: Some of them are completely absurd too , like   they want to enter , but it 's closed , Grad D: That 's uh   Well Grad B: it 's night time , you know there are tourists and all this weird stuff happens at the line up and you 're like Grad C: Yeah , the only like possible interpretation is that they are like  come here just to rob the museum or  something to that effect . Grad B: confused . Grad D: In which case you 're supposed to alert the authorities ,  and see appropriate action . Grad B: Yeah . Grad C: Yeah . Yeah , another thing to do , um , is also to , um  I guess to ask around people about other Bayes - net packages . Is Srini gonna be  at the meeting tomorrow , do you know ? Grad D: Maybe . Grad A: The day after tomorrow . Grad C: Wait Grad D: Quite possibly . Grad A: Wednesday . Grad C: Day after tomorrow . Grad D: Oh , oh , sorry . Grad C: Yeah . Grad D: Sorry , Wednesday , Grad B: Who 's talking on Wednesday ? Grad C: Maybe we can ask him about it . Grad D: yeah . Mmm . Grad B: I haven't  J Jerry never sent out a  sent out an email , did he , ever ? Grad C: No . But he mentioned at the last meeting that someone was going to be talking , I forget who . Grad A: Oh , isn't Ben ? Grad C: Uh . Grad D: Ben ? Grad A: Ben , then , Grad D: I think it 's Ben actually , Grad A: Ben . Grad B: Ah ! Grad D: yeah , um , giving his job talk I think . um , Sorry . I was just reading the screen . Grad A: OK . Grad B: Yeah . Grad C: Oh . Grad A: So the uh  That will be one  one thing we could do . I actually uh , have  Um , also we can uh , start looking at the SmartKom tables and I will Grad B: Right . Grad A: I actually wanted to show that  to you guys now but um . Grad B: Do you want to  trade ? Grad A: Um , no I  I actually made a mistake because it  it fell asleep and when Linux falls asleep on my machine it 's  it doesn't wake up ever , so I had to reboot Grad D: Oh , no . Grad A: And if I reboot without a network , I will not be able to start SmartKom , because I need to have a network . Grad B: Uh Grad A: So we 'll do that t maybe uh Grad C: But . OK . But once you start  sart start SmartKom you can be on  You don't have to be on a network anymore . Is that the deal ? Grad A: Yep . Grad C: Ah , interesting . Grad B: Why does SmartKom need a network ? Grad A: Um   it looks up some stuff that ,  you know , is  is that  is in the  written by the operating system only if it  if you get a DHCP request , so it  you know , my computer does not know its IP address , you know ? Grad B: Ah . Grad A: You know . So . Unless it boots up with networking . Grad B: It 's plugged in . Yeah . Grad A: And I don't have an IP address , they can't look up  they don't know who localhost is , and so forth and so forth . Grad D: Hmm . Grad A: Always fun . But it 's a , um , simple solution . We can just um , go downstairs and  and  and look at this , but maybe not today . The other thing um  I will  oh yeah , OK , I have to report  um , data collection . We interviewed Fey , Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: She 's willing to do it , meaning be the wizard for the data collection , also  maybe transcribe a little bit , if she has to , but also recruiting subjects , organizing them , and so forth . So that looks good . Jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her , see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard . And I talked to Liz about this and it looks as if Friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data . Grad C: So who would be the subject  of this trial run ? Grad A: Pardon me ? Grad C: Who  Will there be a  Is one  Is you  one of you gonna be the subject ? Like are you Grad A: Um Liz also volunteered to be the first subject ,  which I think might be even better than us guys . Grad D: Good . Grad B: One of us , yeah . Grad A: If we do need her for the technical stuff , then of course one of you has to sort of uh  jump in . Grad B: I like how we 've  you guys have successfully narrowed it down . \" Is one of you going to be the subject ? \" Is one of you  jump in . Grad D: Reference . I haven't done it yet . Grad C: Well I just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good . Grad D: Oh plants ? e u someone who can plant difficult things . Grad C: Yeah . I mean that 's what we wanna  check , right ? Grad A: Um , Grad D: Well , in this case it 's a p it 's a  sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject . Grad C: Isn't that what it is ? Grad D: It 's uh Grad A: yes w we  we would like to test the wizard , but  you know , if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get a more realistic Grad C: I guess that would be reasonable . Grad D: Yeah . Grad A: you know , set up as Grad B: Yeah . I know . That 's probably a good enough test of Grad D: Uh - huh . Grad A: Yeah . Grad C: Sort of having an actively antagonistic , uh Grad D: Yeah . That might be a little unfair . Um . Grad A: Yeah . Grad D: I 'm sure if we uh ,  You think there 's a chance we might need Liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? I 'm sure we can get  other people around who don't know anything  um , if we want another subject . Grad A: Yeah , yeah . Grad D: You know . Like I can drag Ben into it or something . Although he might cause problems but . So , is it a experimental setup for the um , data collection  totally  ready  determined ? Grad B: I like that . \" Test the wizard . \" I want that on a T - shirt . Grad A: Um  I think it 's  it 's  it 's  I mean  experimental setup u on the technical issue yes , except we st I think we still need uh  a recording device for the wizard , just a tape recorder that 's running in a room . Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: But um  in terms of specifying the scenario ,  um  uh  uh  we 've gotten a little further Grad D: Mm - hmm . Grad A: but um  we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard , and have the wizard partake in the  ultimate  sort of definition probe . So  so if  if on Friday it turns out that she really likes it and  and we really like her , then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and   getting all the details completely figured out ."}

Project Manager: Um but it's something to think about , yeah . User Interface: Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah . Project Manager: I mean we'll have to see how much that would be . Marketing: Or some  it i we can find out probably on the internet  how much it's Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um Marketing: What was the word ? User Interface: Furry . Marketing: Water resistant . Project Manager: Oh I was just Marketing: No but it's  I thought , ah , spot on . Marketing: Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . User Interface: Yeah . Mm , mm . Marketing: That's quite annoying . Project Manager: Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: like that's another Marketing: Yeah , clip . Ooh  . Um . Project Manager: Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ , Industrial Designer: Yeah I think so . Project Manager: yeah  um is going to be looking more into the working design .

PhD D: So . Yeah . Professor B: That 's interesting .  That 's interesting . Do you see ? Because  Uh , PhD D: Uh . Professor B: so  No , that  that 's important . So what  what it 's saying here is just that \" yes , there is a reduction  in performance ,  when you don't  um  have the s  when you don't have  um PhD A: Task data . Professor B: Wait a minute , th th the PhD D: Hmm . Professor B: No , actually  it 's interesting . So it 's  So when you go to a different task , there 's actually not so  different . It 's when you went to these  So what 's the difference between two and three ? Between the one point one case and the one point four case ? I 'm confused . PhD A: It 's multilingual . PhD D: Yeah . The only difference it 's  is that it 's multilingual  Um Professor B: Cuz in both  in both  both of those cases , you don't have the same task . PhD D: Yeah . Yeah sure . Professor B: So is  is the training data for the  for this one point four case  does it include the training data for the one point one case ? PhD D: Uh yeah . Grad F: Yeah , a fraction of it . PhD D: A part of it , yeah . Professor B: How m how much bigger is it ? PhD D: Um  It 's two times , Grad F: Yeah , um . PhD D: actually ? Yeah . Um . The English data   No , the multilingual databases are two times the  broad English  data . We just wanted to keep this , w well , not too huge . So . Professor B: So it 's two times , but it includes the  but it includes the broad English data . PhD D: I think so . Do you  Uh , Yeah . Professor B: And the broad English data is what you got this one point one  with . So that 's TIMIT basically right ? PhD D: Yeah . Grad F: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So it 's band - limited TIMIT . This is all eight kilohertz sampling . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Grad F: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Yeah . Grad F: Downs Right . Professor B: So you have band - limited TIMIT ,  gave you uh almost as good as a result as using TI - digits  on a TI - digits test . OK ? PhD D: Hmm ? Professor B: Um  and  um But ,  when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size ,  it  um performs worse on the TI - digits . OK , now all of this is   This is noisy  TI - digits , I assume ? Both training and test ? Professor B: Yeah . OK . Um OK . Well .  We  we  we may just need to uh  So I mean it 's interesting that h going to a different  different task didn't seem to hurt us that much , and going to a different language um It doesn't seem to matter  The difference between three and four is not particularly great , so that means that  whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal . PhD D: Mmm . Professor B: It sounds like um  uh  we may need to have more  of uh things that are similar to a target language or  I mean .  You have the same number of parameters in the neural net , you haven't increased the size of the neural net , and maybe there 's just   just not enough  complexity to it to represent  the variab increased variability in the  in the training set . That  that could be . Um  So , what about  So these are results with  uh th  that you 're describing now , that  they are pretty similar for the different features or   or uh PhD D: Uh , let me check . Uh . Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: So . This was for the PLP , Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: Um . The  Yeah . For the PLP with JRASTA the   the  we  This is quite the same  tendency ,  with a slight increase of the error rate ,  uh if we go to  to TIMIT . And then it 's  it gets worse with the multilingual . Um . Yeah . There  there is a difference actually with  b between PLP and JRASTA is that  JRASTA  seems to  perform better with the highly mismatched  condition  but slightly  slightly worse  for the well matched condition . Mmm . Professor B: I have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would  would you mind  running into the other room and making  copies of this ? Cuz we 're all sort of  If we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , I think it 'd be PhD D: Yeah , yeah . OK . Professor B: uh   Uh , I 'll  I 'll sing a song or dance or something while you  do it , too . PhD A: So um Grad F: Alright . PhD A: Go ahead . Ah , while you 're gone I 'll ask s some of my questions . Professor B: Yeah . PhD A: Um . Professor B: Yeah . Uh , this way and just slightly to the left , yeah . PhD A: The um  What was  Was this number  forty or  It was roughly the same as this one ,  he said ? When you had the two language versus the three language ? Professor B: Um . That 's what he was saying . PhD A: That 's where he removed English , Grad F: Yeah . PhD A: right ? Professor B: Right . Grad F: It sometimes , actually , depends on what features you 're using . Professor B: Yeah . But  but i it sounds like Grad F: Um , but    He  Mm - hmm . Professor B: I mean . That 's interesting because  it  it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt  uh because  you  uh didn't have so much representation of English , because in the other case you don't get hurt any more , at least when  it seemed like uh it  it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse , PhD A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: but you have the same number of parameters representing it . PhD A: Mm - hmm . I wonder  were um all three of these nets  using the same output ? This multi - language  uh labelling ? Grad F: He was using uh sixty - four phonemes from  SAMPA . PhD A: OK , OK . Grad F: Yeah . PhD A: So this would   From this you would say , \" well , it doesn't really matter if we put Finnish  into  the training of the neural net ,  if there 's  gonna be ,  you know , Finnish in the test data . \" Right ? Professor B: Well , it 's  it sounds   I mean , we have to be careful , cuz we haven't gotten a good result yet . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: And comparing different bad results can be  tricky . PhD A: Hmm . Professor B: But I  I  I   I think it does suggest that it 's not so much uh  uh cross  language as cross type of speech . PhD A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: It 's  it 's um   But we did  Oh yeah , the other thing I was asking him , though , is that I think that in the case  Yeah , you  you do have to be careful because of com compounded results .

And then the lower part is for Italian and it 's the same   the same thing . PhD A: So , so the upper part is training  TI - digits ? PhD D: So . It 's  it 's the HTK results , I mean . So it 's  HTK training testings  with different kind of features PhD A: Ah . PhD D: and what appears in the  uh left column is  the networks that are used for doing this . Professor B: Hmm . PhD D: So . Uh Yeah . Professor B: Well , What was is that i What was it that you had  done  last week when you showed  Do you remember ? Wh - when you showed me  the  your table last week ? PhD D: It - It was part of these results . Mmm . Mmm . PhD A: So where is the baseline  for the TI - digits  located in here ? PhD D: You mean the HTK Aurora baseline ? PhD A: Yeah . PhD D: It 's uh the one hundred number . It 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio  with respect to the baseline . PhD A: Ah ! Ah , OK , OK . Professor B: So this is word  word error rate , so a high number is bad . PhD D: Yeah , this is  a word error rate ratio . PhD E: Yeah . PhD A: OK , I see . PhD D: Yeah . So , seventy point two means that  we reduced the error rate uh by thirty  thirty percent . PhD A: OK , OK , gotcha . PhD D: So . Professor B: OK ,  so if we take PhD D: Hmm . Professor B: uh um let 's see PLP  uh with on - line  normalization and  delta - del so that 's this thing you have circled here  in the second column , PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: um  and \" multi - English \" refers to what ? PhD D: To TIMIT . Mmm . Then you have  uh MF ,  MS and ME which are for French , Spanish and English . And , yeah . Actually I   I uh forgot to say that  the multilingual net are trained  on  uh  features without the s derivatives uh but with  increased frame numbers . Mmm . And we can  we can see on the first line of the table that it  it   it 's slightly  slightly worse when we don't use delta but it 's not   not that much . Professor B: Right . So w w So , I 'm sorry . I missed that . What 's MF , MS and ME ? PhD A: Multi - French , Multi - Spanish PhD D: So . Multi - French , Multi - Spanish , and Multi - English . Professor B: Uh OK . So , it 's  uh  broader vocabulary . Then  And PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: OK so I think what I 'm  what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was  was  there were some numbers I saw , I think , that included these multiple languages and it  and I was seeing  that it got worse . I  I think that was all it was . You had some very limited results that  at that point PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: which showed  having in these  these other languages . In fact it might have been just this last category ,  having two languages broad that were  where  where English was removed . So that was cross language and the  and the result was quite poor . What I   we hadn't seen yet was that if you added in the English , it 's still poor . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: Uh   Um now , what 's the noise condition  um  of the training data PhD D: Still poor . Professor B: Well , I think this is what you were explaining . The noise condition is the same  It 's the same uh Aurora noises uh , in all these cases  for the training . PhD D: Yeah . Yeah . Professor B: So there 's not a  statistical  sta a strong st  statistically different  noise characteristic between  uh the training and test PhD D: No these are the s s s same noises , Professor B: and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect PhD D: yeah . At least  at least for the first   for the well - matched , Grad F: Well matched condition . Professor B: Right . PhD D: yeah . Professor B: So there 's some kind of a  a  an effect from having these  uh this broader coverage um Now I guess what we should try doing with this is try  testing these on u this same sort of thing on  you probably must have this  lined up to do . To try the same t  with the exact same training , do testing on  the other languages . PhD D: Mmm . Professor B: On  on um  So . Um , oh I well , wait a minute . You have this here , for the Italian . That 's right . OK , so ,  So . PhD D: Yeah . Yeah , so for the Italian the results are  uh  stranger um  Mmm . So what appears is that perhaps Spanish is  not very close to Italian because uh , well ,  when using the  the network trained only on Spanish it 's   the error rate is  almost uh twice  the baseline error rate . Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Mmm .  Uh . Professor B: Well , I mean , let 's see . Is there any difference in  So it 's in  the uh  So you 're saying that  when you train on English  and  uh  and  and test on PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: No , you don't have training on English testing PhD D: There  there is  another difference , is that the noise  the noises are different . Professor B: In  in what ? PhD D: Well , For  for the Italian part I mean the  uh  the um  networks are trained with noise from  Aurora  TI - digits , PhD E: Aurora - two . PhD D: mmm . Professor B: And the noise is different in th PhD D: Yeah . And perhaps the noise are  quite different from the noises  in the speech that Italian . Professor B: Do we have any um  test sets  uh in  any other language that um have the same noise as in  the Aurora ? PhD D: And PhD E: Mmm , no . PhD D: No . PhD A: Can I ask something real quick ? In  in the upper part   in the English  stuff ,  it looks like the very best number is sixty point nine ? and that 's in the uh   the third  section in the upper part under PLP JRASTA , sort of the middle column ? PhD D: Yeah . PhD A: I is that  a noisy condition ? PhD D: Yeah . PhD A: So that 's matched training ? Is that what that is ? PhD D: It 's  no , the third part , so it 's uh  highly mismatched . So . Training and  test noise are different . PhD A: So  why do you get your best number in  Wouldn't you get your best number in the clean case ? PhD C: Well , it 's relative to the um  baseline mismatching PhD D: Yeah . PhD A: Ah , PhD D: Yeah . Yeah . PhD A: OK so these are not  OK , alright , I see . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: OK . And then  so , in the  in the um   in the  non - mismatched clean case ,  your best one was under MFCC ? That sixty - one point four ? PhD D: Yeah .  But it 's not a clean case . It 's  a noisy case but  uh training and test noises are the same . PhD A: Oh ! So this upper third ? PhD D: So  Yeah ."}

PhD D: So it 's always noisy basically , PhD A: Mm - hmm . PhD D: and ,  well , the PhD A: I see . PhD D: Mmm . Professor B: OK ? Um  So uh , I think this will take some  looking at , thinking about . But ,  what is uh  what is currently running , that 's  uh , i that  just filling in the holes here or  or  ?   pretty much ? PhD D: Uh , no we don't plan to fill the holes Professor B: OK . PhD D: but  actually there is something important , is that  um we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization and we just noticed  uh recently that  uh the  approach that we were using  was not  uh  leading to very good results  when we  used the straight features to HTK . Um   Mmm . So basically d  if you look at the  at the left of the table ,  the first uh row ,  with eighty - six , one hundred , and forty - three and seventy - five , these are the results we obtained for Italian  uh with  straight  mmm , PLP features  using on - line normalization . Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Mmm . And the , mmm  what 's  in the table , just  at the left of the PLP twelve  on - line normalization column , so , the numbers seventy - nine , fifty - four and  uh forty - two  are the results obtained by uh Pratibha with  uh his on - line normalization  uh her on - line normalization approach . PhD A: Where is that ? seventy - nine , fifty Professor B: Uh , it 's just sort of sitting right on the uh  the column line . PhD D: So . PhD E: Fifty - one ? This PhD A: Oh I see , OK . Professor B: Uh .  Yeah . PhD D: Just  uh Yeah . So these are the results of  OGI with  on - line normalization and straight features to HTK . And the previous result , eighty - six and so on ,  are with our  features straight to HTK . Professor B: Yes . Yes . PhD D: So  what we see that  is  there is that um  uh the way we were doing this was not correct , but  still  the networks  are very good . When we use the networks  our number are better that  uh Pratibha results . PhD E: We improve . Professor B: So , do you know what was wrong with the on - line normalization , or  ? PhD D: Yeah . There were diff there were different things and  basically ,  the first thing is the mmm ,  alpha uh  value . So , the recursion  uh  part . um ,  I used point five percent ,  which was the default value in the   in the programs here . And Pratibha used five percent . Professor B: Uh PhD D: So it adapts more  quickly Professor B: Yes . Yeah . PhD D: Um , but , yeah . I assume that this was not important because  uh previous results from  from Dan and  show that basically  the  both  both values g give the same  same  uh results . It was true on uh  TI - digits but it 's not true on Italian . Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Uh , second thing is the initialization of the  stuff . Actually ,  uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the  utterance . And using initial values that are the global mean and variances  measured across the whole database . Professor B: Right . Right . PhD D: And Pratibha did something different is that he  uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance  by computing  this on the  twenty - five first frames of each utterance . Mmm . There were other minor differences , the fact that  she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen , and that she used C - zero instead of log energy . Uh , but the main differences concerns the recursion . So .  Uh , I changed the code uh and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the OGI baseline . Professor B: OK . PhD D: We  It  it 's slightly  uh different because  I don't exactly initialize the same way she does . Actually I start ,  mmm , I don't wait to a fifteen  twenty - five  twenty - five frames  before computing a mean and the variance  to e to  to start the recursion . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: I  I use the on - line scheme and only start the re recursion after the twenty - five   twenty - fifth frame . But , well it 's similar . So  uh I retrained  the networks with  these  well , the  the  the networks are retaining with these new  features . Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: And , yeah . Professor B: OK . PhD D: So basically what I expect is that  these numbers will a little bit go down but  perhaps not  not so much Professor B: Right . PhD D: because  I think the neural networks learn perhaps  to Professor B: Right . PhD D: even if the features are not  normalized . It  it will learn how to normalize and Professor B: OK , but I think that  given the pressure of time we probably want to draw  because of that  especially , we wanna draw some conclusions from this , do some reductions  in what we 're looking at , PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: and make some strong decisions for what we 're gonna do testing on before next week . So do you  are you  w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band  or  on  on this , PhD D: Yeah  I Professor B: or  ? PhD D: No , I  we plan to start this uh so , act actually we have discussed uh  @ @ um , these  what we could do  more as a  as a research and   and  we were thinking perhaps that  uh  the way we use the tandem is not  Uh , well , there is basically perhaps a flaw in the  in the  the stuff because  we  trained the networks  If we trained the networks on the  on  a language and a t or a specific  task , Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: um , what we ask is  to the network  is to put the bound the decision boundaries somewhere in the space . Professor B: Mmm . PhD D: And uh  mmm and ask the network to put one ,  at one side of the  for  for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary  decision boundary and one for another phoneme at the other side . And  so there is kind of reduction of the information there that 's not correct because if we change task  and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task ,  obviously the  decision boundaries are not   should not be at the same  place . Professor B: I di PhD D: But the way the feature gives  The  the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the   it removes completely the information   a lot of information from the  the features  by uh  uh  placing the decision boundaries at  optimal places for  one kind of  data but  this is not the case for another kind of data . Professor B: It 's a trade - off , PhD D: So Professor B: right ? Any - anyway go ahead . PhD D: Yeah . So uh what we were thinking about is perhaps  um one way  to solve this problem is increase the number of  outputs of the neural networks . Doing something like , um  um phonemes within context and , well , basically context dependent phonemes . Professor B: Maybe . I mean , I  I think  you could make  the same argument , it 'd be just as legitimate ,  for hybrid systems  as well . Right . PhD D: Yeah but , we know that Professor B: And in fact ,  th things get better with context dependent  versions . Right ? PhD D: Ye - yeah but here it 's something different . We want to have features Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: uh well ,  um . Professor B: Yeah , but it 's still true  that what you 're doing  is you 're ignoring  you 're  you 're coming up with something to represent ,  whether it 's a distribution ,  probability distribution or features , you 're coming up with a set of variables  that are representing  uh ,  things that vary w over context . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Uh , and you 're  putting it all together , ignoring the differences in context . That  that 's true  for the hybrid system , it 's true for a tandem system . So , for that reason , when you  in  in  in a hybrid system ,  when you incorporate context one way or another ,  you do get better scores . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: OK ? But I  it 's  it 's a big deal  to get that . I  I 'm  I 'm sort of  And once you  the other thing is that once you represent  start representing more and more context  it is  uh  much more  um specific  to a particular task in language . So um Uh , the   the acoustics associated with  uh a particular context , for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur  in one language and will occur frequently in the other , so the qu the issue of getting enough training  for a particular kind of context becomes harder . We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data um PhD D: Yeah , but  mmm , I mean ,  the  the way we  we do it now is that we have a neural network and  basically  the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions . Professor B: Right . PhD D: And  uh  binary decisions about phonemes . Nnn  Uh It 's Professor B: Almost . But I mean it  it  it does give a distribution . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: It 's  and  and  it is true that if there 's two phones that are very similar ,  that  uh  the   i it may prefer one but it will  give a reasonably high value to the other , too . PhD D: Yeah . Yeah , sure but uh  So basically it 's almost binary decisions and  um the idea of using more  classes is  to  get something that 's  less binary decisions . Professor B: Oh no , but it would still be even more of a binary decision . It  it 'd be even more of one . Because then you would say  that in  that this phone in this context is a one ,  but the same phone in a slightly different context is a zero . PhD D: But  yeah , but Professor B: That would be even  even more distinct of a binary decision . I actually would have thought you 'd wanna go the other way and have fewer classes . PhD D: Yeah , but if Professor B: Uh , I mean for instance , the  the thing I was arguing for before , but again which I don't think we have time to try ,  is something in which you would modify the code so you could train to have several outputs on and use articulatory features PhD D: Mmm . Mm - hmm . Professor B: cuz then that would  that would go   that would be much broader and cover many different situations . But if you go to very very fine categories , it 's very  binary . PhD D: Mmm . Yeah , but I think  Yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so  you  you have more information in your features . So ,  Um  You have more information in the  uh Professor B: Mm - hmm . True . PhD D: posteriors vector um which means that  But still the information is relevant Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: because it 's  it 's information that helps to discriminate ,"}

Professor B: but the  the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it PhD D: Mmm . Professor B: and   and  we 'll see . But  but what I 'm more concerned with now , as an operational level , is  uh , you know , PhD D: Mmm . Professor B: what do we do in four or five days ? Uh , and   so we have  to be concerned  with Are we gonna look at any combinations of things , you know once the nets get retrained so you have this problem out of it . PhD D: Mmm . Professor B: Um , are we going to look at  multi - band ? Are we gonna look at combinations of things ? Uh , what questions are we gonna ask , uh now that , I mean ,  we should probably turn shortly to this O G I note . Um , how are we going to  combine  with what they 've been focusing on ? Uh ,  Uh we haven't been doing any of the L D A RASTA sort of thing . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: And they , although they don't talk about it in this note , um ,  there 's um ,  the issue of the  um Mu law  business  uh  versus the logarithm , um ,  so . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So what i what is going on right now ? What 's right  you 've got  nets retraining , Are there  is there  are there any H T K  trainings  testings going on ? PhD D: N PhD E: I  I  I 'm trying the HTK with eh ,  PLP twelve on - line delta - delta and MSG filter  together . Professor B: The combination , I see . PhD E: The combination , yeah . But I haven't result  at this moment . Professor B: MSG and  and PLP . PhD E: Yeah . Professor B: And is this with the revised  on - line normalization ? PhD E: Ye - Uh , with the old  older , PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: Old one . So it 's using all the nets for that PhD E: yeah . Professor B: but again we have the hope that it   We have the hope that it   maybe it 's not making too much difference , PhD E: Yeah . But  We can know soon . Professor B: but  but PhD E: Maybe . Professor B: yeah . PhD E: I don't know . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: Uh , OK . PhD D: Uh so there is this combination , yeah . Working on combination obviously . PhD E: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Um , I will start work on multi - band . And  we  plan to work also on the idea of using both  features  and net outputs . PhD D: Um . And  we think that  with this approach perhaps  we could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network . Um , So , get simpler networks , because we still have the features . So we have um  come up with um  different kind of  broad phonetic categories . And we have  Basically we have three  types of broad phonetic classes . Well , something using place of articulation which  which leads to  nine , I think ,  broad classes . Uh , another which is based on manner , which is  is also something like nine classes . And then ,  something that combine both , and we have  twenty f  twenty - five ? Grad F: Twenty - seven . PhD D: Twenty - seven broad classes . So like , uh , oh , I don't know , like back vowels , front vowels . Professor B: So what you do  um I just wanna understand PhD D: Um For the moments we do not  don't have nets , Professor B: so  You have two net or three nets ? Was this ? How many  how many nets do you have ? No nets . PhD D: I mean ,  It 's just  Were we just changing  the labels to retrain nets  with fewer out outputs . PhD E: Begin to work in this . We are @ @ . Professor B: Right . But  but I didn't understand PhD D: And then  Mm - hmm . Professor B: Uh .  the software currently just has  uh a  allows for I think , the one  one hot output . So you 're having multiple nets and combining them , or  ? Uh , how are you  how are you coming up with  If you say  uh  If you have a place  characteristic and a manner characteristic , how do you PhD D: It - It 's the single net , PhD A: I think they have one output . PhD D: yeah . Professor B: Oh , it 's just one net . PhD D: It 's one net with  um  twenty - seven outputs PhD E: Yeah . Grad F: mm - hmm PhD D: if we have twenty - seven classes , Professor B: I see . I see , OK . PhD D: yeah . So it 's  Well , it 's basically a standard net with fewer  classes . Professor B: So you 're sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago instead of  yeah . PhD D: Yeah , but I think  Yeah . B b including the features , yeah . Grad F: But including the features . PhD E: Yeah . PhD D: I don't think this  will work  alone . I think it will get worse because Well , I believe the effect that  of  of too reducing too much the information is  basically  basically what happens Professor B: Uh - huh . PhD D: and Professor B: But you think if you include that  plus the other features , PhD D: but  Yeah , because  there is perhaps one important thing that the net  brings , and OGI show showed that , is  the distinction between  sp speech and silence Because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition . I mean the labels are obtained on clean speech , and we add noise after . So this is one thing And But perhaps , something intermediary using also  some broad classes could  could bring so much more information . Uh . Professor B: So  so again then we have these broad classes and  well , somewhat broad . I mean , it 's twenty - seven instead of sixty - four ,  basically . And you have the original features . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: Which are PLP , or something . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: And then uh , just to remind me , all of that goes  into  uh , that all of that is transformed by uh , uh , K - KL or something , or  ? PhD D: Mm - hmm . There will probably be , PhD E: Mu . PhD D: yeah , one single KL to transform everything Professor B: Right . PhD D: or   uh , PhD E: No transform the PLP PhD D: per PhD E: and only transform the other I 'm not sure . Professor B: Well no , PhD D: This is  still something  that Professor B: I think  I see . PhD D: yeah , we  don't know Professor B: So there 's a question of whether you would PhD E: Two e @ @ it 's one . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: Right . Whether you would transform together or just one . Yeah . Might wanna try it both ways . But that 's interesting . So that 's something that you 're  you haven't trained yet but are preparing to train , and PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: Yeah . Um   Yeah , so I think Hynek will be here Monday . PhD D: Mmm ."}

Um  I asked uh  Hynek whether  I haven't talked to Sunil  I asked Hynek whether  they compared that to  just taking the nets we already had  and summing up the probabilities . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Uh .  To get the speech  voice activity detection , or else just using the silence ,  if there 's only one  silence output . Um  And , he didn't think they had , um .

PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So um Their uh   the results look pretty good . Um ,  I mean , not uniformly . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: I mean , there 's a  an example or two  that you can find , where it made it slightly worse , but  uh in  in all but a couple  examples . PhD D: Mmm . Professor B: Uh . PhD E: But they have a question of the result . Um how are trained the  the LDA filter ? How obtained the LDA filter ? PhD D: Mmm . Professor B: I I 'm sorry . I don't understand your question . PhD E: Yes , um the LDA filter  needs some  training set  to obtain the filter . Maybe I don't know exactly how  they are obtained . Professor B: It 's on  training . PhD E: Training , with the training test of each  You understand me ? Professor B: No . PhD E: Yeah , uh for example ,  LDA filter  need a set of   a set of training  to obtain the filter . Professor B: Yes . PhD E: And maybe  for the Italian , for the TD  TE on for Finnish , these filter are  are obtained with their own training set . Professor B: Yes , I don't know . That 's  that 's  so that 's a  that 's a very good question , then  now that it   I understand it . It 's \" yeah , where does the LDA come from ? \" In the  In  earlier experiments , they had taken LDA  from a completely different database , right ? PhD E: Yeah . Yeah , because maybe it the same situation that the neural network training with their own PhD D: Mmm . PhD E: set . Professor B: So that 's a good question . Where does it come from ? Yeah , I don't know . Um ,  but uh to tell you the  truth , I wasn't actually looking at the LDA so much when I  I was looking at it I was  mostly thinking about the   the VAD . And um , it ap  it ap Oh what does  what does ASP ? Oh that 's PhD D: The features , yeah . Yeah . PhD E: I don't understand also Professor B: It says \" baseline ASP \" . PhD E: what is   what is the difference between ASP and uh baseline over ? PhD C: ASP . PhD D: Yeah , I don't know . PhD E: This is Professor B: Anybody know  any PhD C: Oh . There it is . Professor B: Um Cuz there 's \" baseline Aurora \"  above it . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: And it 's  This is mostly better than baseline , although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases . PhD C: Well , it says baseline ASP is twenty - three mill  minus thirteen . PhD E: Yeah . Professor B: Yeah , it says what it is . But I don't how that 's different  from PhD C: From the baseline .  OK . Professor B: I think this was   I think this is the same point we were at when  when we were up in Oregon . PhD E: Yeah . PhD D: I think   I think it 's the C - zero  using C - zero instead of log energy . PhD E: Ah , OK , mm - hmm . PhD D: Yeah , it 's this . Professor B: Oh . OK . PhD E: yeah . PhD D: It should be that , yeah . PhD A: They s they say in here that the VAD is not used as an additional feature . Professor B: Shouldn't it be PhD D: Because PhD A: Does  does anybody know how they 're using it ? Professor B: Yeah . So  so what they 're doing here is ,  i PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: if you look down at the block diagram ,  um ,  they estimate  they get a   they get an estimate  of whether it 's speech or silence , PhD A: But that Professor B: and then they have a median filter of it . PhD A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: And so um ,  basically they 're trying to find stretches . The median filter is enforcing a  i it having some continuity . PhD A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: You find stretches where the  combination of the  frame wise VAD and the   the median filter say that there 's a stretch of silence . And then it 's going through and just throwing the data away . PhD C: Hmm . Professor B: Right ? So um PhD A: So it 's  it 's  I don't understand . You mean it 's throwing out frames ? Before Professor B: It 's throwing out chunks of frames , yeah . There 's  the  the median filter is enforcing that it 's not gonna be single cases of frames , or isolated frames . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: So it 's throwing out frames and the thing is  um ,  what I don't understand is how they 're doing this with H T PhD A: Yeah , that 's what I was just gonna ask . Professor B: This is PhD A: How can you just throw out frames ? Professor B: Yeah . Well , you  you can , PhD D: i Professor B: right ? I mean y you  you PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: it stretches again . For single frames I think it would be pretty hard . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: But if you say speech starts here , speech ends there . PhD A: Mm - hmm .

Yeah , so I mean in the  i i in the  in the decoding , you 're saying that we 're gonna decode from here to here . PhD D: I t PhD A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: I think they 're  they 're  they 're treating it ,  you know , like uh  well , it 's not isolated word , but  but connected , you know , the  the PhD A: In the text they say that this  this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of . So that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet . Professor B: Well .  No they  they have numbers though , right ? So I think they 're  they 're doing something like that . I think that they 're  they 're  I think what I mean by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that 's plausible for the standard . In other words , it 's  uh  I mean from the point of view of  of uh reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it 's not a bad idea to detect silence anyway . PhD A: Yeah . Yeah . I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this . Professor B: Um . But it 's  the thing is it 's that  that  that 's  that 's I  I  Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice ,  uh uh for listening to , is that these kinds of things  uh cut  speech off a lot . PhD A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Right ? And so  um PhD A: Plus it 's gonna introduce delays . Professor B: It does introduce delays but they 're claiming that it 's  it 's within the   the boundaries of it . PhD A: Mmm . Professor B: And the LDA introduces delays , and b  what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it doesn't introduce  uh , any more delay . I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same  time the LDA  down here  I don't know  Wh what 's the difference between TLDA and SLDA ? PhD C: Temporal and spectral . Professor B: Ah , thank you . PhD E: Temporal LDA . Professor B: Yeah , you would know that . PhD C: Yeah Professor B: So um . The temporal LDA does in fact include the same  so that  I think he  well , by  by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means  if you construct it this way , this  this delay would work in that way PhD A: Ah . Professor B: and then it 'd be OK . They  they clearly did actually remove  silent sections in order  because they  got these  word error rate  results . So um I think that it 's  it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gonna give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation . Whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard , I don't know . Um . Uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the  word models are pretty bad and nobody wants   has  has approached improving them . So  it 's possible that a lot of the problems  with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models  to begin with . So  this might just be a temporary thing . But  But , on the other hand , and maybe  maybe it 's a decent idea . So um The question we 're gonna wanna go  through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been  if you look at what we 've been trying , we 're uh looking at  uh , by then I guess , combinations of features and multi - band Uh , and we 've been looking at  cross - language , cross  task  issues . And they 've been not so much looking at  the cross task uh multiple language issues . But they 've been looking at uh   at these issues . At the on - line normalization and the uh  voice activity detection . And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about  um what do we choose  from what we 've looked at  to um blend with  some group of things in what they 've looked at And once we choose that ,  how do we split up the  effort ? Uh , because we still have  even once we choose ,  we 've still got  uh another  month or so , I mean there 's holidays in the way , but  but uh  I think the evaluation data comes January thirty - first so there 's still a fair amount of time  to do things together it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites  in that  that amount of time . PhD A: When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's   knows when it 's time to back trace or something ? Professor B: Well , see they , I  I think they 're Um . I don't know the   the specifics of how they 're doing it . They 're   they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to  um , change the scripts  for the recognizer ,  I believe . PhD A: Oh , right . Maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something ? Professor B: So . Uh . Uh , you know that 's what I had thought . But I don't  I don't think they are . PhD A: Hmm . Professor B: I mean that 's  sort of what  the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side , yeah you p put some low level noise or something . Probably don't want all zeros . PhD A: Hmm . Professor B: Most recognizers don't like zeros but  but  you know ,  put some epsilon in or some rand PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: sorry epsilon random variable  in or something . PhD A: Some constant vector . I mean i w Or something Professor B: Maybe not a constant but it doesn't , uh  don't like to divide by the variance of that , but I mean it 's PhD A: That 's right . But something that  what I mean is something that is  very distinguishable from  speech . Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD A: So that the  the silence model in HTK will always pick it up . Professor B: Yeah . So I  I  that 's what I thought they would do . or else , uh  uh maybe there is some indicator to tell it to start and stop , I don't know . PhD A: Hmm . Professor B: But whatever they did , I mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: We c we can find out . PhD A: Cuz you gotta do something . Otherwise , if it 's just a bunch of speech , stuck together Professor B: No they 're PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: It would do badly PhD A: Yeah , right . Professor B: and it didn't so badly , right ? So they did something . PhD A: Yeah , yeah . Professor B: Yeah . Uh . So , OK , So I think  this brings me up to date a bit . It hopefully brings other  people up to date a bit . And um Um  I think  Uh , I wanna look at these numbers off - line a little bit and think about it and   and talk with everybody uh ,  outside of this meeting . Um , but uh No I mean it sounds like  I mean  there  there  there are the usual number of  of  little  little problems and bugs and so forth but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out . And now we 're  seem to be kind of in a position to actually  uh ,  look at stuff and  and  and compare things . So I think that 's  that 's pretty good . Um  I don't know what the  One of the things I wonder about ,  coming back to the first results you talked about , is  is  how much ,  uh  things could be helped  by more parameters . And uh   And uh how many more parameters we can afford to have ,   in terms of the uh computational limits . Because anyway when we go to  twice as much data  and have the same number of parameters , particularly when it 's twice as much data and it 's quite diverse , um , I wonder if having twice as many parameters would help . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Uh , just have a bigger hidden layer . Uh But  I doubt it would  help by forty per cent . But   but uh PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: Just curious . How are we doing on the  resources ? Disk , and PhD D: I think we 're alright , Professor B: OK . PhD D: um ,  not much problems with that . Professor B: Computation ? PhD D: It 's OK . Professor B: We PhD D: Well this table took uh  more than five days to get back . Professor B: Yeah . Yeah , well . PhD D: But  Yeah . Professor B: Are  were you folks using Gin ? That 's a  that just died , you know ? PhD D: Mmm , no . You were using Gin  perhaps , yeah ? No . PhD E: No . Professor B: No ? Oh , that 's good . Grad F: It just died . Professor B: OK . Yeah ,  we 're gonna get a replacement  server that 'll be a faster server ,  actually . PhD E: Yes . Professor B: That 'll be  It 's a  seven hundred fifty megahertz uh SUN PhD D: Hmm .  Mm - hmm . Professor B: uh  But it won't be installed for  a little while . PhD C: Tonic . Professor B: U Go ahead . Grad G: Do we  Do we have that big new IBM machine the , I think in th Professor B: We have the  little tiny IBM machine   that might someday grow up to be a big  IBM machine . It 's got s slots for eight , uh IBM was donating five , I think we only got two so far , processors . We had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors . They ended up being five fifty . So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two  that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . And more are supposed to come soon and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory . So I don't think  anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to  spend much time  uh  with it , but uh  Hopefully ,  they 'll get us some more  parts , soon and  Uh , yeah , I think that 'll be  once we get it populated ,  that 'll be a nice machine . I mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there . And uh  and uh a nice amount of memory . Uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast Linux machine . Grad G: And if we can do things on Linux ,  some of the machines we have going already , like Swede ?"}

User Interface: Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . Project Manager: Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal , User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: yeah . User Interface: So if you have the voice recognition , you can  you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it . Project Manager: Okay , b but I think we'll Industrial Designer: Okay , but I'll I'll go into that , Project Manager: yeah . Industrial Designer: because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a  it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing .  We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that . User Interface: Yeah . Right . Industrial Designer: But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source  source . Which brings me to the different energy sources .  Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh  remote controls . Industrial Designer: You really have to imagine like  winding up your  uh User Interface: Great . Project Manager: Well , it would be very new to the market , Industrial Designer: I d Project Manager: but Industrial Designer: It would be very new , Industrial Designer: but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Uh   Well , Industrial Designer: this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching TV uh or when you're  you you have to um make some kind of energy  kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish . User Interface: Like the watch . Industrial Designer: It have  it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing . Project Manager: I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . It's very funny indeed . Project Manager: I mean solar is  of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Indeed . Project Manager: Um hand dynamo User Interface: But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and Project Manager: Well , maybe m User Interface: if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . Project Manager: Yeah , I know . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yes . User Interface: You you walk Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: and uh  but uh you  you're sitting on a couch . Industrial Designer: But you know you know from your own watch  your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy .  the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a  in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something , Project Manager: Yeah . And wha Industrial Designer: well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: So , but maybe  maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries . Project Manager: Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . Industrial Designer: Uh yes , it does . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: I'll come to that later . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .  The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . Um  uh in the indicators we have the LCD displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently User Interface: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four User Interface: Mm-hmm . Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round . Industrial Designer: Yes . That is possible too . Yes . User Interface: But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels  I had some  I had some information about it too . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm ."}

Project Manager: Well User Interface: I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . Industrial Designer: Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions . Project Manager: This will be the remote , right ? User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ? User Interface: Yeah , uh that's a possibility , Industrial Designer: Uh it's do it's done before . Project Manager: Because this is how you keep it User Interface: but Industrial Designer: Yes . It's quite quite good , yes . User Interface: But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for Project Manager: Volume ? Industrial Designer: Well , it's it  well , i what he means is there's an  button integrated in the scroll-wheel . User Interface: A volume , okay . Industrial Designer: There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel . Project Manager: Well , what about mute ? Industrial Designer: About mute . Project Manager: Thi i i m I guess uh th Industrial Designer: Well , yes . Project Manager: this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um Industrial Designer: Okay . Yes . Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay . Project Manager: And click it to muten the device . Industrial Designer: Well , okay . It's quite goods . Project Manager: And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yes . Project Manager: So maybe um  I guess that  that's something you two uh need to think about . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel . Marketing: Um   Uh well , User Interface: Wheel . Marketing: it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: Hmm .  But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: And  Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now . Project Manager: Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . Industrial Designer: So maybe it's not no  . Project Manager: Nokia has a  well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this . Industrial Designer: Hmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons . Project Manager: Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah . Industrial Designer: It doesn't use a   . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here . Project Manager: For you too , yeah . User Interface: Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . Industrial Designer: Wi within reach . Yes , you have to . User Interface: So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect . Industrial Designer: Yes .  yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Project Manager: Okay . Sebastian . Um Industrial Designer: Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate LCD displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: There's  there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation .  About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about . User Interface: Yeah yeah , you can um  I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word  you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So  so User Interface: Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function Industrial Designer: okay . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yeah . User Interface: and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again , Industrial Designer: Okay . User Interface: and then it's um  well , I believe it's uh Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: It performs the action . Yeah . User Interface: Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what  which he believes it is . Industrial Designer: Okay . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: So you say mute , he repeats mute and you  makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function . Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the LCD display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper . Project Manager: Okay . Uh well  uh Industrial Designer: Okay . Project Manager: d did we already decide on the display ? To Industrial Designer: Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about . User Interface: Yeah . Well , I don't have um  I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information  uh y I don't think you need it on a display . Project Manager: No .

Okay , well Project Manager: th Industrial Designer: my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the  a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper . Project Manager: Okay . Good . Industrial Designer: So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . Project Manager: Kineti okay . Industrial Designer: The kinetic thing it  it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm  I think you should combine it with batteries . Project Manager: Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy , Industrial Designer: Otherwise it will not  too advanced , Project Manager: too Industrial Designer: uh well . Project Manager: yeah . Industrial Designer: It's  in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries . Project Manager: Yeah , but that  that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different . Industrial Designer: But  Yes . And I think it's more robust . Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . Industrial Designer: It's more uh Uh it's more functional . User Interface: But what about um the markets  uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium Project Manager: No no , but the uh um  that's what Sebastian said . Industrial Designer: The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . Project Manager: He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different . User Interface: Okay . Oh , Project Manager: So um User Interface: sorry . Yeah . Industrial Designer: So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff , User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: and we should uh use wood or something like that . Project Manager: No , User Interface: And I would think Marketing: And Project Manager: r Marketing: yeah , Project Manager: rubber with colours . Marketing: the  yeah , the older people liked wood . Industrial Designer: Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber . Marketing: No the Project Manager: Colourful and Industrial Designer: Okay . Marketing: Yeah , the younger people liked soft material . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Okay , spongy materials . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy . User Interface: And they can be implemented with a regular chip ? Industrial Designer: So  Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple User Interface: Okay , but we also  uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker Industrial Designer: Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh  a different User Interface: oh , Project Manager: But but do we want the curved uh uh design , User Interface: evalu Project Manager: or Industrial Designer: I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull . Project Manager: I it's too dull . Yeah . Industrial Designer: I don't think c our customers will like it . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot  um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . Okay .

And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh baccalaureate, what does it offer, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence. But just to give you the context, I think, if you were asking about the vast majority of subjects what the view of ColegauCymru\u00a0would be, it would be quite unanimous, but I think on the Welsh bac\u00a0there is a difference of opinion, and I'm sure you'll hear those differences on the panel before you today. We've possibly chosen this panel because there are differences of opinion. So, I just want to give you that context at the outset. To answer the specific question, no, I don't think that employers have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac\u00a0means or what it includes. Personally I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac\u00a0is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I think the skills challenge certificate is a better title, and is something that people understand a lot better than the Welsh bac. So, no, I don't think that employers understand the value or what we're trying to achieve through the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. Sian Gwenllian AM: Which is a big problem. Dafydd Evans: Yes, it's a huge problem, but not only to employers, but also to parents and young people, of course. Dr Rachel Bowen: And I think that that varies by size of employer as well. That, certainly, where there are larger employers, who've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum, they may have more capacity to follow changes, get up to date with how Welsh education is evolving. But we know that most employers in Wales are small or microbusinesses. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine. Nick Brazil: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues\u00a0within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly\u00a0meet with\u2014employers\u2014and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require\u2014the Welsh bac\u2014to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within\u00a0those professional sectors. Not many of them have indicated that the Welsh bac is providing the skills that they require. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac\u00a0initially, but the Welsh bac\u00a0has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the\u00a0year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable. And, as I said, from the employer boards that we have, very few of them understand\u00a0the Welsh bac. They certainly don't mention the Welsh bac and, as I said, are very much questioning the qualifications\u00a0that have been provided to develop the actual professional skills needed within the industries. Sian Gwenllian AM: Kay, is that your experience? Kay Martin: Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications.\u00a0But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they\u00a0want them to be literate, numerate, and they want them to have digital skills. And that isn't captured necessarily in the Welsh baccalaureate. And, so, the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with. Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And, finally, I know you've got strong views as an organisation. Ed Evans: Do you mind if I carry on in English\u2014 Sian Gwenllian AM: Fine."}

They needed to be far more clever in terms of how they joined these things up, and then they would start to get that business input there.", "relevant_text": "Sian Gwenllian AM: Fine. Ed Evans: \u2014just so that a lot of our members will understand when I'm speaking. I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. For my sector in particular\u2014the civil engineering sector\u2014and particularly the\u00a0contracting sector, which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background, the Welsh bac gives them that ability, I guess, not to pursue so much of an academic focus, but to test them in terms of the challenges, but also, to\u2014. And I think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this, and\u00a0supporting schools and colleges to deliver it, they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry. And some children, some pupils, some young people, they respond far, far better to that. And I think that's the issue for me\u2014that we've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. All of my understanding of this is literally as a parent, and that would\u00a0be true of a lot of employers as well. So, perhaps there are differences across the sector, but I think, certainly for my sector, we would really value the growth of the Welsh baccalaureate. Sian Gwenllian AM: What are we going to do, then, to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while, if you feel that it is worth while, of course? Dafydd Evans: I think we need to review the qualification, and I think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within\u00a0that qualification. And I think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications\u00a0board, I think\u00a0the employers\u2014. And the only way we'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what's being done. Because I think that's what the\u00a0vision was for the Welsh baccalaureate\u2014that it was going to improve skills for employment. But, somehow or other we've lost our way. The aim is an excellent one, but I think we've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day, and I think having more input from employers would be a great help. Ed Evans: I will carry on in English, if that's okay. Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, it's no problem. Ed Evans: I would agree. I think we do need more employers involved in this. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in\u00a0my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. It happens at the moment. It's the community benefits clauses that are in construction contracts. They're there to serve a really good purpose, but it's become a little bit piecemeal and a little bit tokenistic, whereas the Welsh bac offers an opportunity\u2014. It's something that's part of the curriculum. It's clearly not functioning well at the moment. It would benefit from that business input. So, why not link up those contractual clauses, which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools so that we have a far more\u00a0structured way of getting employers into schools? At the moment it's a little bit\u2014we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic. We need to be far more clever in terms of how we\u00a0join these things up, and then I think you'll start to get that business input there, but let's not be ad hoc about it. Kay Martin: Could I just add something? We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days\u2014they go for six-week internships. Some learners have got real benefit from that and really raised their aspirations. We've got BTEC learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with Freshfields law in London, which is one of the top law firms in the world. So, there are lots of other programmes as well, and perhaps there's a way of joining it all up together. But, in the college, we've got several different programmes going on with employers and the Welsh bac is one of them, but it's not the one that engages employers the best, certainly in our college.

Therefore, it was important for the committee to understand that although they always tried and put the learner first, funding did drive behaviours, and the Wales bacc was fundable; Career Ready was not.", "relevant_text": "Lynne Neagle AM: You don't need to answer that. [Laughter.] Sian Gwenllian AM: I mean, if there are so many other programmes helping anyway, why do we need it? Nick Brazil: I think that is a very good question, but I will go back to Ed's point, which I think was a very important point, which is that the initial vision for the Welsh bac\u2014I think when we go back a number of years\u2014was a really good, good vision for the Welsh bac. It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. And that's what happens, unfortunately. But I think what Ed said is absolutely right: if you get the engagement of the employers\u2014. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. The actual progress of learners into employment is happening. So, I think the question is: have we got programmes already in place, and do we need another one on top? But the vision initially for the Welsh bac, as I said, I will always be positive about. The vision was a good one. Dafydd Evans: I'd like to expand on what Nick said. It's important for you to understand that although we always try and put the learner first, funding does drive behaviours, and the Welsh bac is fundable; Career Ready isn't. So, yes, there are options out there, but because we're so focused on qualifications and we will only fund qualifications, that drives certain behaviours, and\u00a0I think you need as a committee to be very much aware of that. Suzy Davies AM: Yes, but that was very useful information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said\u2014that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills.\u00a0However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools\u2014well, and indeed colleges\u2014might be tempted to go for it. So, thank you for that. Diolch. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Good morning. What are your views on how well the Welsh bac, at all levels, helps to prepare learners for employment? We've spoken to quite a few learners, and again we've had variable opinions coming back, so it's quite how they, from their perspective\u2014. Dafydd Evans: I think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities. And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs\u2014in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a\u00a0C grade in the core subjects. But that eats into the time that we have to teach young people. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow\u2014no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. So, the priorities, I think, across the sector\u2014. We've given priority to GCSE\u00a0resits\u00a0rather than doing the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. So, at levels 1 and 2, there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they're resitting their GCSEs, and there is much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. Thank you. Nick Brazil: Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh bac is a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification\u2014it's a combination. So, to develop the employability skills obviously is a key part, and developing the skills for employment is a key part. But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac\u2014for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well\u2014that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes\u2014and we all get funded on the outcomes\u2014that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability. So, I think people lose the fact that the Welsh bac is a combination of things. And I think it was interesting, the comment that was made about the Duke of Edinburgh\u2014I thought that's something that we need to think about. Kay Martin: If I could just say as well, our job in the college is to develop skills and employable people, and we use every tool in our box to do that. And, as I said earlier, there are lots of things that we do. The Welsh bac, where it works really well, does help prepare them, I think, for employment, but it's not for everyone, because some people have to do the other things. Some people doing the equivalent of three A-levels, even in a vocational programme, it's too big for them. As you say, they're coming from schools, some of them with very few GCSEs, or they haven't got literacy and numeracy skills, they're being tested and many of them are below level 1 in terms of literacy and numeracy. So, I think it needs to be reviewed, to look at how we could make skilled and employable people. It helps prepare some people\u2014the A-level students for university\u2014but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't."}

Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Is there a difference in how the Welsh bac is valued by learners at the different levels that it is studied? ColegauCymru said that learners may have had a negative experience of the Welsh bac in previous study. Dafydd Evans: That's been a new dimension lately, I think, in that, when the Welsh bac first hit FE, we were leading the way\u2014 Kay Martin: Great advocates. Dafydd Evans: \u2014and great advocates. By now, of course, they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then\u2014'Oh, we've done this at school already. Why are we doing it again at college?' So, I think that's a problem for us as well. Kay Martin: Many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity. So, at level 1 and level 2, it's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges,\u00a0but at level 3 it's more, especially for A-levels, because it can help them get into university, but even for the more able and talented\u2014we were discussing this, weren't we? We have learners who do four A-levels, but they don't do the Welsh baccalaureate because they're part of the Seren network, and they are going to be applying for Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. So, the Welsh bac, although it's technically universally adopted by universities, it isn't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university. So, to get into some areas, like dentistry, for example, and some of the other Seren-type activities, four A-levels is better. But in most colleges that\u00a0have A-level students it's almost compulsory to do the Welsh bac as well, but normally that would be three A-levels and the Welsh bac\u2014normally. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And then ColegauCymru say that, increasingly, the Welsh bac is not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level. So, are the different levels of the Welsh bac valued differently by further education professionals? Nick Brazil: Yes."}

In some areas, and certainly the local universities around here\u2014University of South Wales, Cardiff Metropolitan University\u2014value it in a great number of subjects, particularly in sport, when their students went to Cardiff Met, and business studies, when our learners went to USW. However, some of the universities are not valuing the Welsh baac. They do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade.

Dr Rachel Bowen: Yes. Nick Brazil: I think we've got to bear in mind when the students come to us\u2014certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners\u2014that a number of them have come from school and\u00a0probably not done as well as they'd hoped at their GCSEs. Okay, they've come to us, they're trying to build themselves back up, build their skills back up, and adding another qualification on top, adding the Welsh bac on top, whether that's foundation or national, on top of what they have to do, which is a programme they've come and decided to do\u2014think of the pressure that increases upon them. Plus the fact is that they are resitting; they're probably having to resit GCSE English and maths as well. That's a huge volume of work for a learner who's probably come from a\u00a0low base to begin with and who hasn't achieved what they wanted to. The whole idea when we bring them in at that level is that we want to build their confidence, build them up and, hopefully, eventually they will go to the stage where maybe the Welsh bac will be beneficial to them, when they've potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. But I think it's questionable, certainly at national and foundation. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.' They want to see some difference, they want to see some progress, and that's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels. Dr Rachel Bowen: And we know that delivery in schools is of variable quality, so obviously that impacts on how learners have experienced it and perhaps how they view it when they get to FE college. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay.\u00a0A question, then, just to ColegauCymru: to what extent do you believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh bac? Kay Martin: Well, we don't think they do, really, especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to Russell Group universities. They do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade. I talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a Russell Group university because she had the Welsh bac as well, but it was a very paper-based exercise. But I think it is mixed, and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they're going into in universities. In some areas, and certainly the local universities around here\u2014University of South Wales, Cardiff Metropolitan University\u2014value it in a great number of subjects, particularly in sport, when our students go to Cardiff Met, and business studies, when our learners go to USW. It is valued by them and they accept it, but when people go further afield\u2014and we're always trying to push our learners beyond. Where they can afford to go away to university, we encourage that. But some of the universities are not valuing the Welsh baccalaureate. Lynne Neagle AM: Did you have a supplementary, Si\u00e2n? Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. You didn't mention Cardiff University there. Kay Martin: Cardiff University\u2014yes. My daughter's example\u2014that was Cardiff University. So, they do, especially now it's graded at level 3. Then they do accept it. A great number of our learners get into Cardiff using the Welsh baccalaureate, but would their admissions tutors prefer four A-levels? Absolutely."}
{"relevant_span": [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61], "query": "What did Dafydd Evans think of the baccalaureate when talking about the comparison of the Welsh bac to other qualifications?", "summary": "Dafydd Evans thought that the baccalaureate had evolved into quite a rigorous, complicated, qualification, which put added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they were trying to get possibly three A* grades. Therefore, he thought that they needed to consider that. Moreover, he also mentioned that Welsh universities were much more willing to recognise the bac and they had a long track record of getting learners into top universities.", "relevant_text": "Kay Martin: Cardiff University\u2014yes.

A great number of our learners get into Cardiff using the Welsh baccalaureate, but would their admissions tutors prefer four A-levels? Absolutely. Nick Brazil: Could I jump in there? I've got to jump in there as, from the institution I'm in, we've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. About 20 per cent of our learners go to Russell Group universities, and there is no doubt\u2014in certainly 50 per cent of those, they do not value the Welsh bac. But if they do offer an option with the Welsh bac, they say it is on top of three A2-level grades. So, obviously, we've had that track record. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the Welsh Government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses, but you look through the range, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects as well, across a number and range of universities,\u00a0the Welsh bac is always added as the additional one. So, bear in mind, then, that Welsh students are fighting for places against Scottish, Northern Irish and, potentially, English students who are studying three subjects, whereas our Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s, three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac. And, as we talked about earlier on, the Welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous, you could say complicated, qualification, which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they're trying to get possibly three A* grades. So, I think we need to consider that. In relation to the first answer, it is variable, and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicates about facilitating subjects, and Welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject. Lynne Neagle AM: Si\u00e2n. Sian Gwenllian AM: Maybe Dafydd can give us the picture from north Wales. Dafydd Evans: I mentioned before coming in, in terms of the context\u2014. Because of the nature of our catchment area, there is a greater percentage of our students staying in Welsh universities, and, as Kay said, Welsh universities are much more willing to recognise the bac. So, to a certain extent, it is less of a problem. But, naturally, we do have students who are looking to go out to universities in England in the Russell Group, and we're having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities. Sian Gwenllian AM: But in terms of Bangor and Glynd\u0175r University, there's no problem there, though. Dafydd Evans: No, there is no problem there. Julie Morgan AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning. I think you've already got into this bit of the discussion, but what are your views on how comparable the Welsh bac is to other qualifications? I don't know if you've got any more comments on that. Dafydd Evans: Well, obviously, as we noted, it's become a very rigorous, very large qualification. Actually, it's probably larger than an A-level by now. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that's absolutely fine, but I think one of the problems that you're hearing is that perhaps the Welsh bac is trying to be all things to all men. At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up to a Russell university's expectations, and on the other hand, it's trying to develop softer skills and employment skills for people going into work from a vocational area. Can the same product deliver those two outcomes? I'm certainly not sure, and perhaps we need to think: what are we trying to achieve with this qualification? Julie Morgan AM: Right."}

Because Cambridge university said to us they thought, in the four A-levels that they asked for, that those skills were there. But if a learner wanted to go into a particular sector and the Welsh qualification was not accepted, it was not comparable.", "relevant_text": "Julie Morgan AM: Right. Kay Martin: Yes, and earlier, we talked as well about that difference for the A-level students. They know what it is. It's worth UCAS points. For the vocational students, some things like the Career Ready programme, which is used in other colleges, and WorldSkills, you know, where all colleges have really been pushing to get more learners into WorldSkills at national and international level. And for some of our learners, particularly if we take our engineering learners, then having somebody who has competed in Europe as a tiler or an electrician would, I think, make an employer think, 'I'd better look at this person', whereas the other one\u00a0has done the Welsh bac\u2014.\u00a0I think they would look at the WorldSkills person first. And the investment we have to put into WorldSkills is huge. So, for some of our learners, we choose that you do WorldSkills, because that is going to be more valuable for you as a skill, and to show to an employer how much extra time you've put in. So, they put a lot of time\u2014you know, to get somebody into a WorldSkills competition is not just a couple of hours a week, it isn't just the normal curriculum\u2014they have extra time. They are more able and talented vocational learners, and that is more valuable to those learners and I think it's more valid for employers than the Welsh baccalaureate. Nick Brazil: I think it's got to, extending on what Kay says\u2014. It's got to be\u2014. You know, it is comparable, as long as it's right for that learner's future. If it's right for the learner's future, absolutely it's comparable. But if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the Welsh bac is not accepted, it's not comparable. But, then, if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector, absolutely. But it's got to be right for the learner. Julie Morgan AM: What are the reasons why some colleges do see it as being rigorous and others don't? Why does the view vary? Ed Evans: Can I give perhaps an employer's perspective on that, which might be completely wrong, but it's been interesting listening to what's been said here? About a year ago, we bought the\u00a0WJEC in to speak to our employers, or a number of them, just to explain to them what the Welsh bac was about\u2014back to listening and about understanding, really, and it just was not there at all. I could see that most of the employers\u00a0there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels. We've kind of gone into an university discussion here, but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. The skills that they bring having gone through this process I think most of the employers could get, at least in my sector, they could understand\u2014'I can see what that person can do.' But we've also seen it from university-educated people as well. They are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things. Those that bring a little bit of world experience, a little bit of the Welsh bac-type of things, just become far more rounded and useful people. I can understand why there's a certain obsession, almost, with the academic side of it, but I think we lose that vocational bit at our peril, and to a certain extent we probably haven't got it in many quarters anyway. So, for me, the Welsh bac helps to build that. Call it something else maybe, but that's what it should do. Julie Morgan AM: Right. And those skills that are learnt in the Welsh bac, can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications? Because I know that Cambridge university said to us they thought, in the four A-levels that they asked for, that those skills were there. Kay Martin: It probably depends on the subjects that\u00a0people are studying and the combination of subjects and the institution. Generally, in college, even if they're doing A-levels, they go out on some community projects or work-related education, without the Welsh bac\u2014even if they're not doing that. So, it does depend on the subject, I think. Dafydd Evans: I think there's a real danger of us perhaps becoming overly critical here as well of the Welsh bac\u00a0in terms of\u2014I don't think it's perfect by a long way, however, learners are getting some value out of that process. Certain learners in departments where they have really worked hard to contextualise the Welsh bac\u00a0within the vocational area, within the A-level subjects that the learners are doing, are finding it very rewarding. So, there are some very positive things coming out there. I think what we're suggesting is there may be even better ways of doing it and better ways of explaining to people what it's about. Nick Brazil: On this point about the skills being developed, I think that's debatable if all the skills that are supposed to be developed in the Welsh bac\u00a0are being developed, and that's why I think there's a need to relook at it to make sure those skills are being developed fully. But I will go back to the point that I think a comparable qualification is comparable as long as it achieves the right outcome for that particular learner. If you force a learner to do something that is not necessarily going to achieve the outcome that they require in their future, is it the right thing to be doing for that learner? That's what my concern is. Dr Rachel Bowen: I think the baccalaureate\u00a0approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look to teachers not as sources of information but just for guidance. That whole sort of approach about creating inquisitive young people with the skills that we've discussed, that's a real positive. The chances are that we've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification. The approach is a positive one."}

The chances are that we've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification. The approach is a positive one. Suzy Davies AM: Yes, to both Rachel Bowen and Nick Brazil, if you don't mind. Both of you mentioned this is about skills and a piece of paper that demonstrates that you have these skills. At pre 16, would it be fair to say that there have been occasions when people have come presenting those pieces of paper but actually show none of the skills that they were supposed to have? The reason I'm asking this question, having had children who've gone through the process myself, is that in some schools, and I'm not saying all, doing the bac\u00a0is something that everybody does in the last four weeks of term, and that undermines the whole idea of the bac\u00a0anyway. It's just not fair on the learners or the people teaching the bac. Is that a fair observation? Dr Rachel Bowen: I think it's perfectly possible for learners to reach FE college having attained the Welsh bac\u00a0under the process that you've described, and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see. Nick Brazil: Yes, and at interview process or during an interview, or in the first week, you can see that they haven't developed those skills, and I think it is down to the variable models that have been put in place. There are lots of different models, and if you put, as I said, the model that you've described in place, there is no way, in that period of time, you're going to develop those skills. But that indicates, again, the value that people are putting on the qualification, if they are squeezing it into three or four weeks of term. Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some questions now then, from Suzy, on universal adoption. Suzy Davies AM: Well, I'm wondering if I need to ask them, really, because I think I'm getting a strong sense that you all think that universal adoption is a bad idea at this moment in time. However, I do want to test something, because we have had witnesses who say that it would be a good idea because it reduces the amount of competition and advantage that certain institutions have. So, for example, we had an indication from the union representing Welsh-speaking teachers that if the baccalaureate was universally adopted, it would remove an artificial choice, basically, for learners,\u00a0i.e. they were losing Welsh-speaking students who didn't want to do the bac to English-speaking institutions. So, I wonder if you could tell me how much the decision in your individual colleges not to offer bac\u00a0is down to the opportunity that it presents you to attract students, particularly from sixth forms, where students may be obliged to do the bac. Kay Martin: That is not the case, I would say. When a learner comes to us, we\u2014. I'd like to think that all the staff in all the colleges do what is in the best interests of the learner. In some cases, it's to go back to school, and we absolutely say, 'You need to go back to school.' If somebody comes from a Welsh-medium school, then usually I will speak to the head and make sure that we have\u00a0a programme in place, that either they're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of Welsh, or that we make sure that they absolutely keep their Welsh language skills. We don't say, 'Come to us and you don't have to do the Welsh bac,' because if they do A-levels, we say it's compulsory, unless you're in the Seren group. Suzy Davies AM: Yes. Well, that's the point; it's about English-speaking students, not just Welsh\u2014. Kay Martin: No, it isn't used. In the majority of colleges across Wales, it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool, because most of us, as you see, we value the Welsh bac. We'd like some changes to the Welsh bac, but we value the Welsh bac\u00a0in many cases. So, we wouldn't deliberately\u2014. I mean, if a course in my college doesn't want to do the Welsh bac, they have to come and give me evidence about why they don't think it's fit and what they're going to do in place of it. So, we don't deliberately tell people, 'Come\u00a0on in and you won't have to do it.' Suzy Davies AM: Okay, can I run that across you all, in an outburst of honesty?"}

No, sorry, 'forced' is not the word. [Laughter.] We have encouraged and persuaded everybody to do it. Suzy Davies AM: So, that will be four A-levels plus bac. Dafydd Evans: Yes. Nick Brazil: I've got to be honest, at present, with our college, we do not ask. It's compulsory for A-level students to do the Welsh bac. It's an option of one of our choices\u2014we have a large choice\u2014and I think it comes back to that fact that we're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions. I think it's something we all need to consider across the nation, that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future. I will go back to the point I made earlier\u2014everything's comparable as long as it's the right thing for the learner's future, and I genuinely believe, and I'm sure a lot of colleagues believe, that that choice element is important to a learner, okay. If it is the right choice and if the Welsh bac\u00a0is the right choice, that is correct, and we move that along. Obviously, we debated about where there are elements that need to change. But you've got to be doing the right things for the learner, and we are certainly not selling it, 'Come\u00a0to us; you don't do the Welsh bac.' It is part of what we offer. It is part of what the college's curriculum offers\u2014there is no doubt about that\u2014and then people make a choice according to what they need to do to actually progress to what they need to do in their future. Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you. I've just got one question for Mr Ed Evans, if that's okay. You explained earlier that if people knew what the bac was about in your sector, they'd value it more greatly, which I accept. Are you worried at all, though, that some of the more able and talented STEM students, in particular\u2014who are needed in your sector, after all\u2014might be deterred from doing those four A-levels because of the bac, because, presumably, you need a mix of these talents? You talked about the more able and talented vocational learners, but also you have more able and talented academic learners\u2014presumably you need them all."}

It was about that mix.", "relevant_text": "Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you. I've just got one question for Mr Ed Evans, if that's okay.

You talked about the more able and talented vocational learners, but also you have more able and talented academic learners\u2014presumably you need them all. Ed Evans: We do. There's a big range, and some really high achievers coming into the sector as well. So, it is about that mix. I think the discussion that I've had with our employers has been around the academic side of things, if you like. The qualifications are well catered for. So, it's almost a given somebody's been through that route. What isn't there is some of those softer skills, but also some\u2014. I was almost going to call commercial skills 'soft' there\u2014. Suzy Davies AM: Call them 'commercial'. Ed Evans: Commercial skills are hard skills, which are very, very difficult to come by. So, the Welsh bac starts to do some of those things at different levels. Again, I'll come back to the input of businesses to support that delivery of commercial skills and so on, but I think I probably made that point earlier. So, I don't think it is a case of squeezing things out. There's clearly going to be different individuals who will cope better, and they will be, I guess, maybe guided as well by parents to a certain degree in terms of, 'You do those four and forget about that nonsense there', which is not helpful, but I can understand why that happens. So, for me, now, it's not a case of squeezing\u2014. This should be seen as an important part of creating a rounded individual ready for employment. I guess that's what a lot of our employers saw the Welsh bac\u00a0as being able to do. Whether that's a shared view is another matter. Suzy Davies AM: That's great. Thank you. Nick Brazil: Can I just add something to that? I think Ed's just said about the softer skills. Do the softer skills have to be developed through qualification? I think Kay mentioned a programme earlier on within her college. We run programmes as well. They're not qualifications, but they offer the opportunity to develop those softer skills. So, I think we're all in agreement about the development of the skills, but does it need to be through a qualification? Lynne Neagle AM: And you've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner. Are you aware, then, of any young people who are coming to you from the Swansea area because they've got that flexibility, which they may not have in one of the local schools? Nick Brazil: As I said, in terms of our offer, we offer a range in the curriculum. We're not going out there saying, 'Come\u00a0to us for this particular reason.' Lynne Neagle AM: No, but does anybody come to you and say, 'Well, actually, I've really come here because I don't have to do the Welsh bac'? Nick Brazil: The honest answer is it's one of the first questions that people always ask. But, as I've said, as a parent, I've been to open evenings and other open evenings. It's generally a question that people ask,\u00a0'Do\u00a0I have to do the Welsh bac?' It does come across not just in our open evenings, but in other open evenings that I've been to. It is always a question that people ask me. They do want to know that, and it's usually, as I said, one of the first questions that they ask."}

There are some places in, I would think, some sixth forms now, where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra\u2014Welsh bac. So, for example, modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in Wales, and, I think, I picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is, 'We have to put our focus on the Welsh bac\u00a0to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language.' Sian Gwenllian AM: But it could be a short-sighted view because what some young people tell us is that at the time\u2014and parents\u2014they didn't really appreciate what skills they were actually learning, and by the time they'd got into employment, that working as a team, the communication skills, they thought, 'Ah, we\u00a0did\u2014. I know what this is about', and it all makes sense at that point. So, to try and, sort of, discourage it at a younger age may be doing them a disservice in the long run. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Well, we'll move on now then to\u2014. Sian Gwenllian AM: That's a question. Lynne Neagle AM: You do want an answer. Anybody want to pick that up?"}

But where we are delivering it well, well contextualised, they've really enjoyed the experience, and very much valued the experience. So, yes, there are certainly instances of that happening, there's no doubt. Ed Evans: We certainly see it, as employers. The penny drops after a few weeks or\u00a0months. Dafydd Evans: But don't underestimate the fact that\u00a0if you had a poor experience of the Welsh bac\u00a0at school, that perception is very difficult for us, as institutions, then, to change. Very difficult. Dr Rachel Bowen: It does make it into quite an intensive selling process for colleges when they've got to overcome that negative perception. As people have said already, it is possible to talk parents and learners round, but then that's time spent having to do that selling job when we should be talking about other things. Kay Martin: Can I just mention as well that there's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not A-levels? Perhaps you might want to do an engineering BTEC programme, or you might want to do a health and social care, or you might want to do hospitality. You might want to do BTEC\u00a0programmes, you can still go to university if that's what you want to do, or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards, and selling that whole range to parents, because there is an overemphasis, by us all, on A-levels\u2014. Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that? Dafydd Evans: I'm not assured in terms of\u2014yes, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. When we were bringing lecturers from outside\u2014'Welsh bac\u00a0specialists' in inverted commas\u2014it was not working well. It has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum. Therefore, no, I think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and we've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac\u2014. It's been an intensive staff development process. Nick Brazil: And I think you've got to bear in mind that the number of the skills and the number of challenges that are done within the Welsh bac\u00a0are done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well. So, a number of those staff have already got those skills and they're undertaking that. I suppose when it comes to the word 'credibility' used in terms of the qualification, yes, I'm sure it would raise that focus on it, but ultimately, it's taking away from the fact that we have got staff who've got those skills and they're developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications they're doing. Something we were talking about earlier on is the fact is that, sometimes, that work is being repeated twice, because of the nature of the qualification. Dawn Bowden AM: And have you got dedicated time? Because one of the things we picked up from schools was that teachers in particular were kind of fitting it in with other lessons, and therefore, it wasn't being, again, given the same perceived level of importance as doing A-levels were. But your lecturers would all have dedicated time to deliver\u2014 Kay Martin: On their timetables, yes. And as you say, industry specialists delivering some of those things put them more into context."}

There had been a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement, knowledge and opportunity for the broad principles of what they were doing. They were also looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out their approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas.

So, they would make a statutory provision for the 'what matters' statements.", "relevant_text": "Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received no apologies for absence. Suzy Davies is going to be arriving a little bit late. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No? Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is an evidence session to scrutinise the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Claire Bennett, who is deputy director for curriculum and assessment. Thank you all for attending this morning, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so if it's okay, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking you what the main messages are that you've received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum. Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Chair. If I may, I think it's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been. So, there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement, knowledge and opportunity as possible. So, working through the regional consortia, approximately 120 separate events were organised, and we believe that in the region of 6,000 headteachers, teachers, governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in those events. We also held a number of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves, so that they could give us their feedback. There were 24 focus groups that were arranged for children and young people. We also held some specific events to engage with the business community. We'll all be familiar, won't we, with the narrative of, 'Oh, we're sending people out into the world of business without the skills that we as an employer are looking for'. So we thought it was really important to engage business so that they can have their say and their input into the process. And obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their say. So, Members, I'm sure, will have been aware of the specific pages on Hwb that outlined the draft curriculum, and we had 275,000 unique visits to the Hwb curriculum pages. It's really interesting to see the breakdown of the areas of learning and experience\u2014which particular AoLEs were the most popular and were being looked at the most\u2014with our creative and performing arts and the creativity and the expressive arts being the most popular. So that's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular AoLE. What, then, have people said to us? Well, I'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing. There's real support for the need for change, because that's the first question, actually; why are we doing this, and why do we need to change? So, support for the need for change, and lots of support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum. So, good levels of support for the four purposes, and that driving the content below it. Strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession\u2014so, the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities. Also, a great welcome of the emphasis on formative assessment and the importance of formative assessment. In terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at, some of that is around some of the language used. Can we clarify, can we simplify in some areas, are there things that are repeated in a variety of AoLEs? Can we use that as an overarching, rather than repeating ourselves? Can we simplify it and clarify some of the language? Also, in some areas\u2014. It's interesting; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down, but in other areas, people say, 'Well actually, in this bit of it, we need a bit more detail, and a bit more depth and clarity'. So we'll be reflecting on all the feedback that we've had. That process has already started, but considering that this is a massive change, I have been hugely encouraged, actually, by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we're doing. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you, Minister. You said that you're reflecting on the messages that you've received. Are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance? Kirsty Williams AM: I think what's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession, we are doing it with our profession. So, in the spirit of co-construction, the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present.\u00a0So, Members will be aware that we've slightly changed the model. We had our pioneer school model and we have slightly refined that now. Pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward, and we've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools. But above and beyond the innovative schools, we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas, and they're the first part of that process. So, they met last week to begin looking at the feedback, and we'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine. Are there big changes to the concept? No. Opportunities to do things better, explain things better, simplify where possible, where we've been told that that needs to happen, provide greater depth where we've been told that needs to happen\u2014absolutely. We're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those, but in terms of the overall concept, then no, no significant changes. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. And what are the steps now before the final curriculum is published in January 2020? Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, the quality\u2014. We call them\u2014it's not a very nice name\u2014quality improvement practitioners, the QI practitioners. So, these are the subject specialists. They met last week to begin this process. In October, there will be a number of workshops lasting three days at a time where those practitioners will continue that process of feedback with our curriculum and assessment group and all those people involved. By November, we would expect the QI groups to have completed their work and would want them to be in a position to hand over the refinements to an editorial process, and that has to be done in both languages. I think it's really important that we don't do it in English and then we simply translate it into Welsh. So, the editorial process will then be engaged to draw up the final example. It also, then, hands over to the publication team to do all the work on the publication, our website team will then be working on it, and then we would expect final publication in January\u2014am I right, Claire? Claire Bennett: Yes. Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, January. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. We've got some specific questions now on the legislation from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Sian Gwenllian AM: You've touched on the point that there's going to be some sort of change, and you've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation. We want to know what those aspects will be and what has made you change your mind. Kirsty Williams AM: The original proposal that we began working on was, in the legislation, to provide for the four purposes\u2014so, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation\u2014as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects\u2014so, the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency\u2014as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory, so, for instance, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports. A good example of that is relationships and sexuality education. I've already made an announcement that I was going to put RSE on the face of the Bill. So, the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the Bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody\u2014. So, we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters' statements. So, we're bringing it a step lower again. Rather than simply, in law, leaving it at the AoLE level, we'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters' statements within that, again, providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level. We'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas. So, there has been in the Chamber\u2014I can see Suzy is writing this down\u2014Suzy has asked me questions about, 'How do you create a national expectation around progression?' We've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process, so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out. As I said, we are proposing those changes because of responses that we've had. One of the consistent worries that some people have had, whilst being very supportive of the overall aims, is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school, but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern. So, we've reflected on that. I set up a process\u2014this was an open process, and we were open to listening to people. So, I think those will be the two main areas where we hadn't originally thought that we would legislate for, but that we will now legislate for. Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. I haven't got the 'what matters'\u00a0statements in front of me\u2014 Kirsty Williams AM: Well, if you remember, we have the four purposes, and then we have the areas of learning and experience, and then, below the areas of learning and experience are the broad concepts that we would expect to be delivered in each of those areas of learning and experience. So, we're going to be refining some of those. Some of the feedback that we've had is that\u2014 Sian Gwenllian AM: So, will you be adding to those?"}

Kirsty Williams AM: Adding is not necessarily\u2014no, not adding. But, for instance, the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience. So, they'll be refined, but not added to, and then we will legislate for them, and that hadn't been the original intention. Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Will they include mental health and well-being? Kirsty Williams AM: Well, the area of learning and experience for well-being is already there, and underneath that area of learning title, there are the broad concepts of what matters, what we believe matters, in that area of learning, and it is that that we will now actually put into the legislation. Sorry, I'm not helping, because I haven't got them with me either to read them out. Lynne Neagle AM: They are in the annex to the paper, Si\u00e2n, and, obviously, mental health is in there. So, just to clarify, then, that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law. Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, because the 'what matters' states very clearly the broad concepts in health and well-being. It refers to both physical and mental health, and we intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system. Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Kirsty Williams AM: Claire, am I explaining it okay? Claire Bennett: Yes, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. These are the essence of the core content. So, the idea is to make sure that those are consistent, and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those, which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them. But the concept that you might not do one 'what matters'\u2014it was never what was intended. They were always intended to represent, as a whole, the learning that every learner should get. They won't be literally in the Bill, because, obviously, you might want to change the emphasis, so that'll be provided for in subordinate legislation, but the provision will be there, and they will have the status of something that's not optional, basically, for a school. Sian Gwenllian AM: Therefore, it's not going to be on the face of the Bill\u2014the mental health aspect, for example. And there are other matters that we've raised here. This is what I'm not clear about. You're saying that it's subordinate, but then you're saying\u2014 Kirsty Williams AM: So, on the face of the Bill, we will make provision to say that the 'what matters' statements have to be delivered. Over time, the 'what matters' statements might change. So the actual wording of the 'what matters' statements will be in secondary legislation; the need to deliver and the requirement, the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement, will be on the face of the Bill. So, for instance, education is changing all the time. If I think, if we had sat here 20 years ago, we probably, in a 'what matters' statement on health and well-being, wouldn't have referred to mental health, 20 years ago, because our understanding as a society, our willingness as a society to engage in that\u2014. So, if we had drawn up a 'what matters' statement even a decade ago, I suspect we wouldn't have talked about mental health. So, the concept of having to deliver the 'what matters' statement will be in the primary legislation; the actual wording, because otherwise if you wanted to change it you'd have to go through the entire process\u2014. So, the wording of the 'what matters' statement will be in secondary legislation. The actual need and the compulsion, the expectation that you have to do that, will be on the face of the Bill. Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you had a supplementary. Suzy Davies AM: Just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation. The point you've made is one that Government has made with other legislation prior to this, but can I just ask you to consider the worthiness, if you like, or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters' statements, the first round of those, in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course? The reason I ask this is just to explain to the population of Wales that there is certainty at the first step, bearing in mind that it will change over the years\u2014I completely accept that. But when you're amending primary legislation, you don't have to go through the whole process again\u2014you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that. So, I'm just asking you to consider that."}

So, I'm just asking you to consider that. Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, as I said, I think we've demonstrated that we're listening to people, that there has been concern expressed about certainty and having a national approach on some of these issues, and we have taken steps to address that and we'll continue to reflect, but, crucially, we'll continue to reflect with our partners who are co-constructing this with us. And I think the important thing to remember is that it's not Ministers or civil servants that are necessarily drawing up these 'what matters' statements, it is practitioners themselves, guided by experts in the field that are not teachers, that have come up with these things. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Obviously, the Bill will presumably come to this committee\u2014 Kirsty Williams AM: We're assuming so. Lynne Neagle AM: And we'll have an opportunity to influence it. Si\u00e2n. Sian Gwenllian AM: Moving on, therefore, to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education, I understand that you've had numerous responses to the White Paper surrounding this particular area. What are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what's been said? Kirsty Williams AM: Well, these two areas certainly have ensured that lots of people have responded. It's interesting that people are far more interested in what we may or may not do about these two subjects than maths, English, Welsh, science, but there we go; I guess it's the nature of the areas that we're talking about. With regard to religious education, we had a significant number of people that have expressed concerns about our approaches towards RE that were set out in the White Paper. I think amongst the things that people have objected to were\u2014. There were very mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions included in that area of learning. Many people said that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger\u2014and in some cases exclusive\u2014focus on Christianity, as opposed to including other world religions and, indeed, non-religious views. So, secular views or spiritual\u2014spirituality rather than organised religion. There were people who thought that RE shouldn't be compulsory at all and therefore our proposals to ensure that RE was compulsory, people objected to that, on the other\u2014. And there were many responses that were concerned about and emphasised the need to respect parents' views. So, if a child's parents have certain views, those are to be respected. Of those respondents that agreed that RE should be a compulsory part of the curriculum, or were neutral\u2014didn't express an opinion either way, but were neutral on the question\u2014the issues that they were bringing forward were: a need for learners, as they saw it, to be prepared to be part of a diverse and multicultural society. So, they wanted RE to be much more broad-based and encompassing of world views and world religions. They felt that that was an important part of preparing a young person to live in a world that is, as you say, diverse with people of different views living in it. There is certainly a need to modernise RE; some people perceived the current curriculum as a bit old-fashioned. And also there was much feedback on making sure that the profession was ready to deliver a renewed, modernised RE curriculum. So, those are the issues around religious education\u2014 Sian Gwenllian AM: Can I just\u2014? Before you go on to the next section\u2014is there evidence that this was a co-ordinated lobby to present a particular view and what is your response going to be to this? Obviously, there are always going to be lobbies presenting particular viewpoints. Our role, as politicians, is to lead, obviously, isn't it? Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. Claire, would you say that it was a co-ordinated response? Claire Bennett: It wasn't a campaign in the sense of it being completely consistent, but, certainly, I think people with a particular interest in this issues felt galvanised to respond to the White Paper on this issue\u2014on this one and on relationships and sex education. Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And your response? Kirsty Williams AM: And my response: well, clearly, Si\u00e2n, I need to consider those responses, and both for RE and RSE, I shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues. With regard to RSE, the key messages, again, are focused on whether children should be taught RSE at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it shouldn't be a compulsory part of the curriculum\u2014that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education. There were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum. So, those were the main areas that people were concerned about. With regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum, there were strong views that, again, it should be parents, and parents alone, that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules. So, I have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise. I think these are really important aspects of our curriculum. I think if we are to achieve the four purposes, and that's how we have always got to think about it, and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system\u2014how do we achieve those purposes? How are they healthy, confident individuals? How are we to prepare our children to be ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world? So, we will reflect on what has come back to us, but I do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum, if we are to achieve the four purposes. Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you. You've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. What is the timetable for the Bill itself and for seeking Royal Assent for that?"}

You've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. What is the timetable for the Bill itself and for seeking Royal Assent for that? Kirsty Williams AM: Okay, so, as I said earlier, the expectation is that we will publish a final version of the curriculum in January 2020, so schools will then have the opportunity to be really engaging in it. I have to say, I'm in schools most weeks, and many, many, many schools are already taking the opportunity, even on the draft, to begin to think about planning and, indeed, changing what they're doing in schools. I'm overwhelmed, actually, by the enthusiasm of the sector to embrace what is a massive change for them. So, that's January. We would expect to introduce the Bill following the Easter recess. Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. That gives enough time, then, for it to be\u2014 Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. Sian Gwenllian AM: \u2014actually implemented in September\u2014 Kirsty Williams AM: In 2022. Sian Gwenllian AM: In 2022, yes. Kirsty Williams AM: And I think what's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in January itself, because that's the bit that schools are really concerned about, and then we will have the process here to underpin it. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. Hefin David AM: Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? Kirsty Williams AM: I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. Hefin David AM: Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools."}

And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. Hefin David AM: What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. Hefin David AM: So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. Kirsty Williams AM: Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes. Hefin David AM: Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. Hefin David AM: It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. Kirsty Williams AM: I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. Hefin David AM: Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 Hefin David AM: Bridges have been built. Kirsty Williams AM: Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on."}

Kirsty Williams AM: And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. Hefin David AM: And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot. Steve Davies: As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. Kirsty Williams AM: The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. Hefin David AM: When did that take place? Kirsty Williams AM: Where? Hefin David AM: When. Kirsty Williams AM: The weekend just gone. Hefin David AM: Right. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014"}
{"relevant_span": [71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86], "query": "Summarize the discussion about the quality control of the curriculum.", "summary": "According to Kirsty, one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What they learnt was to actually get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network.", "relevant_text": "Kirsty Williams AM: The weekend just gone. Hefin David AM: Right. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 Suzy Davies AM: This isn't about assessment. Lynne Neagle AM: Oh, okay. Go on, then. Suzy Davies AM: So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 Suzy Davies AM: Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. Steve Davies: In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? Claire Bennett: I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. Kirsty Williams AM: And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. Suzy Davies AM: Can I just have a quick\u2014? Lynne Neagle AM: Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. Suzy Davies AM: Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? Kirsty Williams AM: I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. Suzy Davies AM: Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you."}

They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar. Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. I'll keep my questions shorter. Lynne Neagle AM: The next questions are from Dawn Bowden. Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Yes, just around preparations for the implementation, really. You touched on this briefly in response to some questions from Hefin David earlier on, but I'm just interested to know how the money that you announced for supporting teachers for the preparation of the implementation, how that's actually been used. What specifically have teachers been doing to prepare for its implementation? I know you've set aside about \u00a324 million over two years. So, it's not an insignificant amount. I just wondered how that was being utilised. Kirsty Williams AM: You're right, first of all, it's not an insignificant amount; it's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. So, you're right that it is not insignificant, and it was a hard-won resource, I can tell you, from my colleagues. Because, as I said earlier, the curriculum itself can be amazing, but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it, then all this change will be for nothing. So, investing in the profession is absolutely crucial. That money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we've just heard from Claire, there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain. There are other schools that maybe are only beginning now, now that it's published, to be really engaging with the curriculum. Dawn Bowden AM: So, there hasn't been a national programme, as such. Kirsty Williams AM: There is a national element to it, but we've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because I have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they're going to need. There's no way I can know that. The people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools. But we have worked with the National Academy for Educational Leadership to put together a programme for headteachers, and that's national. The four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement. So, actually, the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum. The next stages will be much more focused on individual AoLE and area-specific professional learning. So, there is a national approach in terms of leadership. The regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants, and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics. Claire referred to the AoLE networks, and there's an opportunity then for people to engage in that. It's also important to say that that's not the end of the process. So, this September is the start of our new ITE courses, taught for the first time, and that's great. I'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ITE. So, we're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support, again on a national basis, for those who are newly qualified, beginning their teaching career, because I don't think we've done that on a consistently good level across the country. We're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system. We're also involved in\u2014and I'm sure the committee has heard about it, so forgive me if I'm going over old ground\u2014schools as learning organisations and the OECD work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation. We know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong, strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system, and we've not been very good at that in Wales, we've not been strong at that, that's not the culture that we have had. We've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you're good or bad, rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about, 'What are we doing well and what do we need to improve on?' So, the schools as learning organisations are an important part, again, so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the OECD. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. And the money that you announced for this\u00a0\u00a0professional development preparation, if you like, was for two years. So, there's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development, as well as anything else. But is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues? Or do you see what you've put in as being, 'This is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation. The rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that'? Kirsty Williams AM: The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and, clearly, I continue to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning, and I'm sure this committee and, indeed, members of this committee could help me in that task. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay, fine. Can you tell us a bit about the innovation schools\u2014the 16 innovation schools\u2014and how you've made your decisions about who they might be, across which sectors, in primary, secondary and so on? So, basically, how they were selected and what you're expecting of them. Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase, which is innovation schools, and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within Welsh Government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us, going forward. I think one of the lessons learned, and this was said in the committee, was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools, but there was a downside to having pioneer schools, and I think, at this stage of the game, we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now\u2014everybody had to be a pioneer\u2014because this is coming down the track and we don't want anybody just sitting there waiting until September 2022 and saying, 'Oh, gosh. I've got to do something new today'. Not that they would have done that, but\u2014. So, the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we've all got to engage in this now. The innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement, and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues. Steve. Steve Davies: Yes. There were 60 applicants from 170 previous pioneer schools. We've had 16\u2014four per region. It was important that we engaged with the regions to get their view, and we've had evaluation being carried out\u2014 Claire Bennett: Yes. So, during the first term of work, we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole\u2014so, take the whole curriculum guidance and then think, 'How would I apply that in the school?, Does it make sense?, Can we work with it?, What are the issues?, What are the questions that arise for us for assessment?', and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on, 'If I were putting this into practice\u2014'. So, it's slightly different to the feedback we've had from other people, which has been more, 'Maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording' and kind of quite practical, and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school. That's been drawn together into an overall report, drawing out the themes, by Wavehill, who are a kind of research company. It's been really useful, and the innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week. Having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable, in just making us think, even with all the practitioners that have been involved, 'How do we make this work for schools?', given that we've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically. So, it's been invaluable, and they're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically."}

So, it's been invaluable, and they're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically. Kirsty Williams AM: If you think of the pioneer model, pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. So, you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being, or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum. This is about, at this stage, where we have a high degree of certainty about what it's going to look like, 'Actually, how do I as a school practically implement this in the round?', and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that. But also we did need a mix of sector\u2014secondary, primary\u2014but also linguistically, to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we've got. Faith schools, as well, are involved. So, just trying the practical implementation now, now that we know exactly\u2014not exactly\u2014 but we have a good idea what it's actually going to look like, so, 'How am I going to go about doing this?' Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Si\u00e2n has a supplementary. If I could ask as well, maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools. Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, sure. No problem at all. Sian Gwenllian AM: Are you confident that every school across Wales is participating in this process of change now, because the danger is, in getting these pioneer schools\u2014? I understand that they are discussing in clusters, and so on, but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now? Steve Davies: I can't tell you that, absolutely, 100 per cent are definitely, totally, absolutely equally involved. The structure we've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually\u2014not readiness to engage\u2014start to deliver as we move through to the future. So, each region is a member of our operations board, which was in our governance structure. And we don't have a roll-call against all schools, but we require them, or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks. Every school is part of a network that links to it, and they gauge (1) the level of activity in it, (2) the outcomes of that work, because each of the networks, each of the clusters, produces work that the region brings together. But we've not got a monitoring system that says, 'Tick every box'. What I would say, and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to Scotland, I think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this, it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver. At a regional level, we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model. Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Dawn. Dawn Bowden AM: I just wanted to clarify, because in your paper you talk about giving \u00a330,000 to each, or to the innovation schools. Was that \u00a330,000 each, or \u00a330,000 for the project? Kirsty Williams AM: Each school that participates in the innovation schools programme gets \u00a330,000. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you for that clarification. My final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in Wales. So, teachers trained in England apply for jobs in Wales, but they obviously haven't been trained in the new curriculum. How are we actually going to deal with that? Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, you're right\u2014we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in Wales will teach in England and teachers trained in England or who have worked in England will come across the border, as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools. I think that that will continue to happen. Indeed, when I'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues, I think Wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals, as well as an exciting new curriculum. So, I think, actually, potentially, we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it'll be a great place to be a professional. Clearly, already in some ways, programmes of study are already distinctive in Wales. We have a different exam board, if you're teaching at a secondary level. So, our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system. I believe that that's not a barrier to people continuing to do that. Clearly, there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with, but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system, because we've just talked about the two years' worth of money; in an ideal world, if I was able to make long-term plans, I think there will be an ongoing, and there should always be an ongoing, provision for professional learning in our classrooms. And this shouldn't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets. One of the ways in which I think we can attract teachers to Wales is to send a very clear message\u2014 and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession, wherever they train\u2014that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning. So, I do not see that this is an insurmountable issue. Dawn Bowden AM: So, you'll still be recruiting on the basis of skills and adaptability and so on. Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, of course. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chair."}

Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, of course. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chair. Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We've got a lot of issues to cover, so I'm going to appeal for concise questions, concise answers. On to assessment, progression and accountability\u2014Suzy. Suzy Davies AM: Okay. We've set the scene. What was the feedback like with regard to the draft assessment proposals? Lynne Neagle AM: Excellent, concise question. [Laughter.] Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, the principles were broadly supported, Suzy. We received what I would describe as positive feedback regarding the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment that is there to support children's learning and progression. Key messages were perhaps to find a better way of expressing the purposes of assessment\u2014we refer to a formative and summative assessment\u2014and just being a bit clearer about what that actually means and being clear about definitions around it. But, generally, supported. Suzy Davies AM: Okay. That's a good concise answer as well. Lynne Neagle AM: Yes, well done. Suzy Davies AM: Obviously, we're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well. Presumably, the way you're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate, and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be\u2014. They're out in a separate document; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document\u2014is that right? There's a thick black line between these two concepts. Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, absolutely. I think some of the trouble that we've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability, and, when you start using assessment for accountability purposes, that's when, potentially, that assessment process gets corrupted and you have gaming. Suzy Davies AM: Can I ask, with the assessments, though, which is about pupil progression, will those results be published internally? Will parents get to see those? Kirsty Williams AM: Oh, yes. And that should be the purpose for assessment. The primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents, whether they're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment. So, absolutely, you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods, whichever type they use, with parents, to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child. Suzy Davies AM: Right. I accept that. Is it realistic, then, to expect parents, families, communities, not to think about that information when they're drawing conclusions about the school, notwithstanding that formal evaluation of those schools is going to be done completely separately? Kirsty Williams AM: Well, of course, parents will always be interested in how the overall institution is doing. But the conversations I have with parents, and I certainly feel this myself as a parent\u2014I'm interested in how my child is doing, how my child is getting on in school, what are the issues that that child has, and, more importantly, what is the school going to do about it? So, if my child is struggling for whatever reason, what is the school going to do about that to help that child? If my child happens to be exceptionally able and talented, how are you as a school going to make the most of my child's talents and move them on to fulfil their potential? So, undoubtedly, I can't control assumptions that parents will make, but it is absolutely clear in this system, and my intention is, that teachers should share assessment methods and outcomes with parents to have that conversation about what happens next. But I am absolutely clear that we do have to make this distinction between assessment for learning and an accountability in the system, otherwise we drive\u2014inadvertently; people don't set out to do it, but we drive a set of behaviours that has negative unintended outcomes. We only have to look at the debacle around BTEC science to know that. Suzy Davies AM: Okay. I understand that. So, how\u2014? Can you just briefly give us an indication of how you think the accountability, on both sides of that thick black line\u2014the methodology\u2014is likely to change with this?

Without pre-empting the findings of such a review, have you got your top three likely expected changes? Kirsty Williams AM: To accountability? Suzy Davies AM: Yes. Kirsty Williams AM: To accountability. Well, we're moving to a system of schools as learning organisations, and a greater emphasis on self-evaluation, with external verification of that by Estyn, our inspectors. Suzy Davies AM: And that will be reflected in the school categorisation system as well\u2014will those indicators change, do you think? Kirsty Williams AM: Well, categorisation\u2014again, the purpose for categorisation is not to make a judgment on a school in the sense of a league table; it's a triage process, categorisation. Suzy Davies AM: It's how it seen, though, sometimes. Kirsty Williams AM: Well, this is the issue, isn't it? This is the problem of designing a system where there are perfectly good reasons to introduce the system\u2014and in this case it's a triage system to identify levels of support for a school. But then others come along and turn it into something else that it was never intended to be. And categorisation was never intended to be a way of expressing a league table of school performances; it's there to identify levels of support that a school can expect from its regional consortia. Now, we have, we have\u2014we will continue to keep categorisation, but, since coming into office, we have tried to adapt categorisation simply away from pure data to a more formative assessment process, and categorisation will continue to evolve. The message is very clear: this is not to absolve our system of accountability. And the first level of accountability in that system has to be the professionalism of an individual member of staff\u2014the moral purpose that I bring to my classroom today to do right by the children that are in front of me. That's the first level of our accountability, and therefore we have our new teaching standards. As a leader, we have new leadership standards. That's the first part of our accountability regime\u2014the moral purpose our professionals bring to their work. So, categorisation will stay. Will it evolve? Yes, because it's been evolving over the last three years. This is about better accountability, smarter accountability, not less accountability. Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, just finally on that, there may be an argument, then, for scrapping categorisation, putting something else in place. But I suppose the core question is: how are the general public going to understand all those things that you've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach, the leaders being able to lead, and how well a school is performing against KPIs on those measures? Kirsty Williams AM: Well, because we will still\u2014. We will still have inspections, won't we? Suzy Davies AM: Okay. So, it's all going to go in through the Estyn reports.

Will you just let me have this one? Lynne Neagle AM: Go on, then. Sian Gwenllian AM: With regard to the creative thinking element of PISA, I take it that you are adhering to the fact that the Welsh Government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to PISA 2020. I don't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking. So, why not participate in these tests? Kirsty Williams AM: Because, for me, the key factor for making that decision, and I intend to stick to it, is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum\u2014 Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay, so it's the timing. Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, for me. Sian Gwenllian AM: So, later on, maybe when this is embedded\u2014 Kirsty Williams AM: I think there could well be a different decision at a later date, but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it. Can I just say? In terms of creativity, Wales is seen as an exemplar by the OECD, especially our partnership with the Arts Council of Wales and creative learning through the arts. Sian Gwenllian AM: I get that. That's why I don't understand why we're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the PISA. But, I understand. Kirsty Williams AM: There could well be a different decision, but for 2021 we're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with. I just don't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system. The very opposite is true. We are seen as exemplars by the OECD\u00a0and some of the work that's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally. Sian Gwenllian AM: So, you'll think about it for the next round of PISA. Kirsty Williams AM: Oh gosh, that shows that Si\u00e2n thinks that I'll be here to make that decision. [Laughter.] That's very encouraging indeed. [Laughter.] Steve Davies: One very quick technical point, Chair. We have not opted out of this. Countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it, and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this."}

They also discussed the feasibility of collecting data from people who are not familiar with the English language.", "relevant_text": "Grad B: OK , PhD F: That 's looks strange . Grad B: now we 're on and it seems to be working . Postdoc E: Oh there we go . PhD C: One two three four five six PhD A: That is weird . Postdoc E: This looks good . PhD A: It 's like when it 's been sitting for a long time or something . Grad B: So , I mean  I don't know what it is . But all  all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine . And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message and I have not yet sat down with  been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code . PhD A: Next time you get it maybe we should write it down . Grad B: Yep , we will . One of these days . Professor D: Yeah . Postdoc E: Was it a pause , or  ? OK . Was it on \" pause \" or something ? Grad B: No . Postdoc E: OK . Don't know . Professor D: So uh  so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , uh , then they can run off . It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , but um , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . So , I th I think  I think we should start doing that . Um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can , uh  I don't know . Wh - what  what were some of the points again about that ? Is it PhD F: Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up . Professor D: Yeah . PhD F: Um , at the previous  at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping  about wanting to get more data and I  I talked about this with Jane and Adam , um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new  this new student di does wanna work with us , PhD A: Well , great . PhD F: th the guy that was at the last meeting . PhD A: Great . PhD F: And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , PhD A: What a deal . PhD F: uh  Yeah . Grad B: And what 's he interested in , specifically ? PhD F: So he 's  comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody , Grad B: Mm - hmm . Great . PhD F: so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts  he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . Grad B: Right . PhD F: But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one  one - time Grad B: One offs ? PhD F: Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the , um  to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about . I mean it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . So . Then I was um , talking to Morgan about some  new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to  listen to . And in that uh , regard , I thought we definitely w will need  it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this  this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I  You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization . Grad B: Mm - hmm . PhD F: Um , and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting  and maybe a networking  group meeting . Grad B: Right . Yep . Yeah , we 're  we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly . PhD F: So  So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough . Grad B: So . Mm - hmm . PhD F: But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting    meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize , Grad B: Yeah . PhD F: but  rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . And then we need a couple that  of   We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds . Grad B: Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting . Professor D: S So PhD C: Yeah . PhD F: See , I 've never listened to the data for the front - end  meeting . Grad B: Yeah , we  we 've only had three . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: So . PhD F: OK . But maybe that 's enough . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar , Grad B: Mm - hmm . PhD F: like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same . Grad B: Um Professor D: Now , let  l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I  I don't disagree with that , but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . Uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , I actually feel the opposite need . I 'd like to have lots of different people . PhD F: Right . Right . Professor D: As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view . I 'd like to have many different speakers . So , um I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and  and uh , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor D: I mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine , Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . PhD F: Right . Professor D: but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people . PhD F: Yeah , I definitely agree with that . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . PhD F: Definitely . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Can I  can I say about that  that the  the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . Because I think if you just say  an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that  that uh , it would be useful for  for purposes  You know . Professor D: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: But you know , I think I 've been  I 've I  I 've gathered data from undergrads at  on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . And  and the English you 'd have  The language models would be really hard to build Professor D: Well , you want to i Postdoc E: because it would not really be  it would be an interlanguage rather than  than a Professor D: Well , OK , uh , first place , I  I  I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I  I think that 's what we 're investigating , Postdoc E: OK . PhD F: It has to be a  a pre - existing meeting ,  like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . Professor D: so Grad B: Right . Professor D: Yeah , yeah . Postdoc E: OK . Grad B: Yep . Professor D: So I was  I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and  and  and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their  hold their meeting down here . PhD F: That 's I think what we  and I agree with . Postdoc E: Oh , interesting ! PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Oh , I see . Oh , interesting ! Professor D: Uh , that 's the first point . The second point is um I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that Postdoc E: Oh , oh . I 'm not saying accents . u The accent 's not the problem . Professor D: Oh , OK . Postdoc E: No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency , e e just simply fluency . Professor D: Yeah . Postdoc E: I mean , I deal with people on  on campus who  I think sometimes people , undergraduates um in computer science uh , have language skills that make , you know  that their  their fluency and writing skills are not so strong . Professor D: Oh ! You 're not talking about foreign language at all . Grad B: Yeah . Yeah , just talking about . Professor D: You 're just talking about Postdoc E: Well , e I just think , Grad B: We all had the same thought . Postdoc E: but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , uh , no problem . I mean , I 'm not saying accents . PhD C: Uh - huh . Professor D: Yeah , then we 're completely gone . Postdoc E: I 'm say I 'm saying fluency . Grad B: Mm - hmm . Professor D: It 's   The  the habits are already burnt in . Postdoc E: Well , yeah . I 'm just saying fluency . Professor D: But Grad B: Well , I think that , um  I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . And  and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English ,  I  I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have uh , g particularly good English skills . Professor D: Yeah . Postdoc E: OK , now can I  can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that um , there 's  there 's this  this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for  for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together . Grad B: Right . Professor D: Right . Postdoc E: And if people want to approach  Um , i so I know  e e  You know this  The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group , Professor D: Uh - huh . Postdoc E: but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data , Professor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in   um , i more fluent , more  more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing . Professor D: I guess  I maybe  Hmm . I Postdoc E: Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have  Uh , so if  if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . If you have people who are using English as a  as an interlanguage because they  they don't  uh , they can't speak in their native languages and  but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , uh , language model , Professor D: Uh - huh . Postdoc E: this is the worst case scenario . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . Postdoc E: And Grad B: Right . Professor D: because  because they  most  the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards . Postdoc E: Well Oh . But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their  in their language proficiency that Professor D: I see . Postdoc E: And I 'm not objecting to accents . Professor D: OK . Postdoc E: I  I 'm  I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a  at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a  a grammar  a grammar , basically , that um , wo would be a  a possibility . Professor D: Uh - huh . Postdoc E: So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it  to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , uh , it seems like um , I don't see that there 's an argument Professor D: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: I 'm  I  what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , uh , useful for the widest range of  of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics . Professor D: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: That 's  that 's my point . Which  which includes both top - down and bottom - up . PhD C: It 's difficult . Professor D: OK . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: OK , well , i i let 's  let 's see what we can get . I mean , it  it  I think that if we 're aiming at  at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK , Postdoc E: Yes , that 's fine . That 's fine . Exactly . And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population . Professor D: but  OK . OK . PhD F: I definitely agree with that , I mean , for this purpose . Professor D: OK . Grad B: Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Grads and professors , fine . PhD C: Yeah . Grad B: So . Professor D: Oh , you age - ist ! Grad B: What 's that ? Well , age - ist .  The \" eighteen \" is because of the consent form . Postdoc E: Age - ist . PhD C: Yeah . PhD F: Right , Yeah . Grad B: We 'd hafta get  find their parent to sign for them . PhD C: \" Age - ist \" . Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: Yes . Postdoc E: Yeah , that 's true . Grad B: So . PhD F: I have a  uh , um , question . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a Professor D: They 're  they 're  yeah , they 're d they 're uh  assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks . PhD F: Cuz I mean , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? And  and I mean , there  there may be a lot more  or  or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could um , record people there . I think we 'd have a better chance Grad B: I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this . PhD F: Right , but  Right . But if there were such a  I mean it 's a remote possibility , then um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . Grad B: Yep . PhD F: So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the  the hardware . Professor D: Well , the other thing  Yeah , I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around . Grad B: Right . Professor D: Uh . But . Um , and Grad B: Well , I know that space is really scarce on  at least in CS . You know , to  to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult . Professor D: Uh  Yeah . PhD F: But you may not need a separate room , you know , Grad B: That 's true . Professor D: Yeah . PhD F: the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something Grad B: True . Mm - hmm . Yep . Professor D: Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something . PhD F: Huh . Grad B: Yep . Professor D: You know . PhD F: I  I think it 's not out of the question . Grad B: Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . Professor D: Yeah . PhD F: Um . So . Grad B: another type of meeting . PhD C: Yeah . PhD F: Right . PhD C: But I  I  I think you need , uh , another portable thing a another portable equipment to  to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI . PhD F: Right . Grad B: Hmm . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: Right . PhD C: Eh and probably . I don't know . Professor D: Yeah . PhD C: Eh , if you  you want to  to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you  you need   It - it would be eh eh very difficult to  to put ,  eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to  to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: Yeah , but  I think if we  if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy . PhD C: Oh - yeah . Grad B: Right ? That 's very easy , PhD C: Ye - Yeah , yeah . Grad B: but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . PhD C: Yeah ."}

PhD C: But I  I  I think you need , uh , another portable thing a another portable equipment to  to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI . PhD F: Right . Grad B: Hmm . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: Right . PhD C: Eh and probably . I don't know . Professor D: Yeah . PhD C: Eh , if you  you want to  to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you  you need   It - it would be eh eh very difficult to  to put ,  eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to  to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: Yeah , but  I think if we  if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy . PhD C: Oh - yeah . Grad B: Right ? That 's very easy , PhD C: Ye - Yeah , yeah . Grad B: but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . We realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . So , um , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues . But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a  of a range of them and that 's OK too . Uh , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ? I mean , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . But  what about  For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone . PhD F: Right , I mean , I c I think there 's Grad B: And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean . Professor D: You actually don't . PhD C: Yeah . PhD F: Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone . Postdoc E: Which one did you mean ? Professor D: You d You don't ne it doesn't  you just need some microphone , somewhere . Grad B: Ye - Yeah . Yep . PhD F: You can use found data . Grad B: Tape recorder . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . Postdoc E: Oh . PhD C: Yeah . PhD F: You  you can . Professor D: You need some microphone , PhD F: You can Grad B: Mm - hmm . Professor D: but I mean PhD F: use  Um , but I think that any  data that we spend a lot of effort  to collect , Professor D: Yeah . PhD F: you know , each person who 's interested in  I mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . Professor D: Right . PhD F: And  So in my case , um , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . Grad B: Not enough for others , right . PhD F: And so  I 'm looking and thinking , \" Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so  forth if it 's  to help th in my interest . \" Grad B: Mm - hmm . PhD F: And other people need to do that for themselves , uh , h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal Professor D: Right . So that PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: But I think that  I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , \" Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , \" well maybe you don't . Grad B: Yeah . For some of it . Professor D: Maybe if  if  If really all you want is to have a  a  a recording that 's good enough to get a   uh , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . PhD F: Right . Grad B: Yep . Professor D: I mean , we  we could have a fairly  We could just get a DAT machine and PhD F: Well , I agree with  Jane , though , on the other hand that PhD C: Yeah . PhD F: So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented . You may say well , \" Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . \" I mean , you don't even need the speech signal . Professor D: Right . PhD F: But what you  what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um  Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . There 's lots of cues you 're not gonna have . Grad B: Right . Professor D: Yeah . PhD F: So I  do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of  of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . PhD C: Yeah . Grad B: Special ? Yep . Professor D: I  I  I  I  I agree . PhD F: Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose  individual studies , so Professor D: Uh but I  I think that the uh  i We can't really underestimate the difficulty  shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . Grad B: Yep . Professor D: And so ,  uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , \" Oh , we 'll just do it up there , \" PhD F: OK . Professor D: If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know  keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o PhD F: So then maybe we should   try to bring people here . Grad B: Here . Professor D: I think the first priority should be to pry  to get  try to get people to come here . PhD F: I mean , that 's that 's  OK , so Professor D: We 're set up for it . Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . Professor D: The room is  is really , uh , underused . PhD F: OK . Professor D: Uh PhD F: Right . Postdoc E: I thought the free lunch idea was a great idea . Grad B: Yeah , I thought so too . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Free lunch is good . PhD F: Yeah , I  And I think we can get people to come here , that  But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of your time  and the overhead in bringing people down . Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . PhD A: No crunchy food . Professor D: Yeah . PhD F: So   Well , it would be  lunch afterwards . Grad B: Well , I was thinking , lunch after . Postdoc E: Yeah . PhD F: Right . And they 'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert . Grad B: Yep . Professor D: Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't  get  they don't  get their food . PhD F: Yeah . Grad B: Um , I had a  I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered . Professor D: Yeah Grad B: Should I pursue that ? PhD F: Oh , definitely , yeah . Grad B: Yeah . So . They  they originally  They 've decided not to do  go into speech . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer , but I 'll send an email and ask . Professor D: Tell them about the free lunch . Grad B: I 'll tell them about the free lunch . PhD F: Yeah . Grad B: And they 'll say there 's no such thing . PhD F: Yeah . Grad B: So . PhD F: I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird Grad B: Right . Professor D: Yeah . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: The  the   The oth the other h PhD F: well , I know , I shouldn't say that . Grad B: That 's alright . No , the they  they 're very weird . PhD F: We need a wider sampling . PhD A: \" Beep . \" PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Uh , \" beep \" Grad B: The problem with engineers is \" beep . \" Professor D: Uh , the  the  They make funny sounds . The o the o the other  The other thing is , uh , that we  we talked about is give to them  uh , burn an extra CD - ROM . Grad B: Yep . Let them have their meeting . Professor D: and give them  So if they want a   basically and audio record of their PhD F: Well , I thought that was  I thought he meant , \" Give them a music CD , \" like they g  Then he said a CD of the  of their speech Professor D: Oh . PhD F: and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , but   You know , I personally  would not want a  CD  of my meeting , Grad B: Mmm . Of the meeting ? PhD F: but  maybe  yeah ,  maybe you 're Professor D: If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you 'd like PhD F: right .  Right . Right . PhD A: Oh , that 's a good idea . Grad B: It 'd be fun . I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . PhD F: Right . Grad B: It 's a novelty item . Professor D: But it als It  it  it also I think builds up towards the goal . PhD F: Right . Professor D: We 're saying , \" Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . Is - is isn't that neat . Then you 're gonna go home with it . It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you , Grad B: Yep . Professor D: but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless , PhD F: Right . Professor D: and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . \" PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: So . PhD F: No , I think that 's a great idea , actually . PhD A: What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the  the transcripts when they come back ? Postdoc E: Alth PhD F: But we might need a little more to incentivize them ,  that 's all . Grad B: Oh , yeah . I mean , anyone can have the transcripts . So . I thought we could point that out . Professor D: Oh yeah . Postdoc E: Yeah . PhD F: Well , that 's interesting . Postdoc E: I hav I have to uh raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff ,  where maybe   You know ? Professor D: Good point . That 's a very good point . Postdoc E: So . Professor D: So we can  so we can Postdoc E: We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage . Professor D: r Right . Grad B: Right . Grad B: Deltas , Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: yeah . So . Professor D: I  I mean , I think the other thing that one  I mean , this is , I think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least  See what I 'd  I 'd  Let me tell you what I would do . I would take just a few features . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , I would just take a couple . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: OK ? Like  like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: OK , so before you do  build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers ,  @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @  build a Markov model of some sort uh , or  or else have features that really are based on um on  on some bigger chunk of time . PhD C: Yeah . Grad B: Context window ? PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: But I think this is a good place to start . But don't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even  even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know PhD C: Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Professor D: what it 's doing , even  You know it 's Uh , I think to know what it 's  to have a better feeling for what it 's Grad B: Yep . Professor D: look at  at som some picture that shows you , \" Here 's  These things uh , uh are  offer some separation . \"  And , uh , in LPC , uh , the thing to particularly look at is , I think  is something  like , uh , the residual PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Um So . PhD C: Yeah . S Postdoc E: Can I ask ? It strikes me that there 's another piece of information um , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me ."}

So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . PhD C: Yeah , because  Yeah yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I  Yeah . But eh I  I  Is my my  my own vision ,  of the  of the project . Grad B: So , some sort of  That 's Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . PhD C: I  eh the  the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two  eh , w has eh several parts , several p  objective Professor D: Mm - hmm . PhD C: eh , because it 's a  a great project . But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh I think  you eh  we have eh   two main eh objective . One  one of these is to  eh to detect the change , the acoustic change . And  for that , if you don't use , eh ,  eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to  to try to  to    to label the different frames , I think  the Ike criterion  or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change . Postdoc E: OK . PhD C: And  Probably .  I  I  I  I would like to  to t prove . Uh , probably . When you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or  or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with   probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the  the  the more eh use eh  use eh  used eh em  normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC . you  you have to  to  to find  you can find the  the mark . You can find the  nnn , the  the acoustic change . But eh eh I  I understand that you  your objective is  to eh classify , to know that eh that zone  not is only  a new zone in the  in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to  to  to know that this is overlap zone . because in the future you will eh try to  to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose . Professor D: Mm - hmm . PhD C: you  you will pretend  to  to  to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm Professor D: Mm - hmm . PhD C: because it 's very difficult to  to  to obtain the transcription  from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . That , you know ,  I  I  I think is the idea . And so  eh the , nnn  the   the system  eh will have two models . Postdoc E: Clustering . PhD C: A model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p uh , will be possible the , eh  the mark , the change and another  another model will @ @  or several models , to try s but  eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class . Postdoc E: OK . Grad B: I 'm  I 'm  I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you  what you said . What  what model ? PhD C: Eh , the  the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to  to recognize , eh with eh  to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer . Grad B: Mm - hmm . PhD C: And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net Postdoc E: So p PhD C: with  the  information we obtain from this eh  this eh study of the parameter with the  selected  parameter to try to eh  to put the class of each frame . Eh  for  the difference  zone Grad B: Features . Yeah . PhD C: you  you eh , eh  have obtained in the first eh , step  with the  for example , BIC eh , eh  criterion compare model Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . PhD C: And   You I don't - u Professor D: OK , but , I  I think  in any event we 're agreed that the first step is PhD C: i Postdoc E: Yeah . Professor D: Because what we had before for  for uh , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: So the first thing is for you to  to build up something that will detect the overlaps . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Right ? So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh , in  in  in  in Grad B: Features ? PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Well , I  again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too  way too big . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth  twelfth - order uh MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: You won't be able to look at it . All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Whereas I think if you have things  if you pick one or two dimensional things , or three of you have some very fancy display , uh , and look at how the  the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on . PhD C: It will be enough . Professor D: Well , you 'll  you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know , PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: so if you look at   Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second ,  and then you look at the third and there 's not  and not too much there ,  you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: right ? And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than  than  than the other , maybe . Uh , and uh on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual ,  will say how well , uh  the low - order LPC  model 's fitting it , which should be  pretty poorly for two two or more  people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for  for one . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: And so  I  i again , if you take a few of these things that are  are  prob um   promising features and look at them in pairs ,  uh , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of \" OK , I now have   uh , doing a bunch of these analyses , I now have ten likely candidates . \" And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . PhD A: I 've got a question . PhD C: Yeah . This Postdoc E: Interesting . PhD C: Sorry . Postdoc E: Hmm . PhD C: but eh , eh  eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to  to  do that and I would eh like to  to know what eh , your opinion . Eh  all this study in the f in the first moment , I  I w I  I will pretend to do  with eh eh equalizes speech . The  the equalizes speech , the speech eh , the mixes of speech . Grad B: With Postdoc E: With what ? With what ? Grad B: Right . Mixed . PhD C: the  the mix , mixed speech . Postdoc E: \" Mixed \" . Thank you . PhD C: Eh , why ? Because eh the spectral distortion is    more eh  a lot eh clearer , very much clearer if we compare with the PDA . Grad B: Right . PhD C: PDA speech file is eh  it will be eh difficult . I Postdoc E: So it 's messier . PhD C: Yeah , Postdoc E: The  the PDA is messier . PhD C: fff !  Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh  is  is low . Professor D: OK . Grad B: Yeah , I think that that 's a good way to start . PhD C: And ,  I don't know Grad B: But . PhD C: I don't know eh uh i i that eh the   the result of the  of the study eh with eh  with eh this eh  this speech , the mix speech eh  will work  exactly  with the  eh PDA files . Grad B: It would be interesting in itself to see . Well , I think that would be an interesting result . PhD C: eh What , I  I mean , what what is the effect of the low ' signal to  to  to noise relation , you know , eh with Professor D: N u We Well , I think  I think  I think it 's not a  it 's not at all unreasonable . It makes sense to start with the simpler signal because if you have features which don't  aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: And so , if you can get  @ @  Uh again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible uh , features  look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves ,   and then collect , uh in pairs ,  and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed  with a bigger classifier . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much Grad B: Right . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: And then you can re - optimize , and so on . Grad B: Yeah . But it I think it would be interesting to try a couple with both . Because it  I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and  And don't Professor D: Hmm . PhD C: Ah , yeah , yeah yeah yeah . Professor D: That 's  well , the  It  it 's  it 's true that it also , it could be  useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . Sure . PhD C: But Grad B: Mm - hmm . PhD C: I  I  I  I think that the  the eh parameter we found , eh , eh  worked with both eh , speech file , Postdoc E: That 's good . PhD C: but eh what is the  the  the relation of eh  of the  performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the PDA speech files . Professor D: Hmm . PhD C: Yeah , I don't know . Professor D: Right . PhD C: But it  I  I  I  I think it will be important . Because eh people eh eh , different groups eh has eh experience with this eh kind of problem . Is  eh is not easy eh to  to solve , because if you  I  I   I have seen the  the  the speech file from eh PDA , and s some parts is  very difficult because you  you don't see the spectrum  the spectrogram . Grad B: Right . Yeah , they 're totally hidden . PhD C: Is very difficult to apply eh , eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see . Professor D: Yeah . Yeah . Well , that  that  that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things  things like harmonicity , and  residual energy are uh , yeah are  are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . PhD C: But I suppose Grad B: Are probably better , yep . PhD C: Yeah , yeah yeah , I  I  I will put eh the energy here . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: Ch - Chuck was gonna ask something I guess . PhD C: You have a question . PhD A: Yeah , I  maybe this is a dumb question , but w I thought it would be   I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA Professor D: Nah . PhD A: because can't you , couldn't you like use beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ? I mean Grad B: Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one . PhD A: Uh - huh . Professor D: Yeah , no , you you 're  you 're right Grad B: But that 's Professor D: that  In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one and  and so that 's PhD A: Is that not allowed with this project ? Professor D: Uh , well , no , I mean , we we don't have any rules , r really . PhD A: But I didn't mean  I w  Given  given the goal . Professor D: I think   I  I think  I think it 's  it 's  it 's a  it 's an additional interesting question . PhD A: I mean , is  is that violation of the PhD C: Oh . No . Yeah . Professor D: I mean , I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one , because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two . PhD A: Mm - hmm PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting  having the ability to detect overlaps is . You know , maybe it doesn't matter too much . PhD A: Right . Right . OK . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: So , this is all pretty early stages . PhD A: I see . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Professor D: But no , you 're absolutely right . That 's  a good thing to consider . PhD A: OK . Postdoc E: There  there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the  to the PDA , then some of the positional information goes away ? PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Well , it  it  it does , i it d it does , but the  the  the issue is that  that PhD A: No , it 's not  it 's not that so much as Postdoc E: And then , And if they 're on the access   on the axis of it , that was the other thing I was thinking . Grad B: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: He  You mentioned this last time , that  that if  if you 're straight down the midline , then  then  the r the left - right 's gonna be different , Grad B: Yeah , we hav need to put it on a little turntable , PhD C: I  I   I  I  I th Grad B: and PhD A: Well , it 's PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: and  and  and in his case , I mean , he 's closer to it anyway . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Postdoc E: It seems to me that  that it 's not  a p uh , you know , it 's  this  the topograph the topology of it is  is a little bit complicated . Grad B: But it 's another source of information . PhD C: I  I  Yeah . PhD A: I don't  I don't know ho PhD C: I  I  I think  Sorry . I  I  I think because the the the distance between the two microph eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is very near . But it 's uh  from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea to  to try to study the binaural eh problem eh , with information , because I  I found difference between the  the speech from  from each micro eh , in the PDA . PhD A: I would guess Grad B: Yep . Professor D: Yeah , it 's timing difference . It - it 's not amplitude , Postdoc E: Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves . Professor D: right ? S Right . Postdoc E: I mean , I know  I n I know that 's a very important cue . Grad B: Yep . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: But I 'm just  I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each  to each person with respect to the PDA , PhD C: No . No . No , no , no . Postdoc E: so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker . Professor D: That 's  That 's fine . PhD A: But th I don't think that matters , though . PhD C: But Professor D: That 's  So  so i @ @  I think the issue is , \" Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? \" PhD A: Right . Professor D: If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it  if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking , PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: wherever they are . PhD A: So it 's sort of like how  how confused is it about where the beam is ."}

I mean , I  I think it 's  I can see the value o Professor D: Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them , but I mean   But the thing is just having two mikes  If you looked at that thing on  on Dan 's page , it was  When  when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Yeah , OK . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Grad B: Yep . Postdoc E: Oh yeah yeah . OK . PhD A: What looked different ? PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Yeah . Professor D: Uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation . Grad B: Cross - co cross - correlation . PhD C: Correlation , yeah . Professor D: Just cross - correlation between two sides . PhD A: Did - Sorry , b uh I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . He was looking at the two Professor D: So cross - correlation is pretty sensitive . Postdoc E: Uh , his a web page . Professor D: You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags . Grad B: Subtract them . PhD A: OK . Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . PhD A: Uh - huh . PhD C: Yeah . Grad B: And you find  They get peaks . Professor D: OK . So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking ,  then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in  in the lag . PhD A: OK . OK . Professor D: So if  at whatever angle you are ,  at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the  in  in the cross - correlation value  function . PhD A: So  so if there 's two Grad B: And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks . Professor D: It 's spread out . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Well , let me ask you , if  if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ? PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . The - the  Oh , I 'm sorry , Postdoc E: No ? Professor D: if they 're right next to one another ? PhD A: If I was  if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking , it wouldn't work . Professor D: i i Postdoc E: Next  next one over n over  on this side of the P  PDA . Grad B: Right . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: There we go . Good example , the same one I 'm asking . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Yeah , e I see . PhD A: Yes . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Versus you  versus  you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one . Grad B: Or  or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . Oh , yeah . Postdoc E: It seems like that would be pretty strong . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Across  the same axis , you don't have as much to differentiate . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Well , we d yeah , we don't have a third dimension there . Yeah , so it 's Postdoc E: And so my point was just that it 's  it 's gonna be differentially  differentially varia valuable . Grad B: Right . Postdoc E: I mean , it 's not to say  I mean , I certainly think it 's extremely val  And we  we humans  n n depend on  you know , these  these binaural cues . PhD C: Yeah , yeah . Professor D: But it 's almost  but it 's almost a   I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . Postdoc E: But . Grad B: Must do .  Yeah . Professor D: There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error uh issue . So th the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error . Postdoc E: Yes . Yeah . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it . Postdoc E: OK . and i and if there  So it  And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side Professor D: Uh , if they 're  if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . Grad B: Yep . Professor D: So if the sensitivity is good enough  and we just  we just don't have enough , uh , experience with it to know how Postdoc E: Yeah . OK . Yeah yeah , OK . Yeah . Grad B: But PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Oh I 'm not  I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that  that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . Professor D: Yeah . Mm - hmm . Grad B: And I think Dan is still working on it . So . He actually  he wrote me about it a little bit , so . Postdoc E: Great . No , I don't mean to discourage that at all . Professor D: I mean , the other thing you can do  uh , if  I mean , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody  convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA . But if you h put a third in ,  you could put in the other axis . And then you know  then you 're sort of  Yeah , then  then you pretty much could cover PhD A: Once you got two Postdoc E: Interesting . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: Well what about just doing it from these mikes ? Postdoc E: Interesting . PhD A: You know ? PhD C: Yeah . Grad B: Yep . PhD C: It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the  the  the separation  I  I think Professor D: Uh @ @   But - but that 's  I mean , we can we 'll be  all of this is there for us to study . Grad B: Then they 're much broader . Yeah , we can do whatever we want . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: But   but  but the thing is , uh , one of the  at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA . Grad B: Whatever you 're interested in . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: Right . Yeah . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Well , that 's  that 's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were  were  were interested in . Grad B: Well PhD A: Mm - hmm . Grad B: Yep . PhD A: Mm - hmm . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Uh , but  you know if you can instrument a room , this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ? Some people at  at  uh , yeah , at Brown and  and  and  and  at uh  um and at Cape , Grad B: Big micro @ @ arrays . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: Didn't they have something at Cape ? Professor D: they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place Grad B: Very finely . Professor D: uh , you know p tens of microphones , and  and uh PhD A: Oh ! I saw a demo . PhD C: Oh , right , oh , yeah . Professor D: And if you do that then you can really get very nice uh kind of selectivity PhD A: Yeah . Grad B: Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array . Professor D: Yeah . Yeah . PhD A: And you could  In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody . PhD C: Hundred . Grad B: And they had very precision . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Grad B: Right . PhD C: Very complex , uh  Yeah . Professor D: Ye - Pretty much . Yeah . Grad B: It was all in software and they  and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it . PhD A: That is cool . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: It was  yeah , it was interesting . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . And you can't just always go , \" well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up \" . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: No , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA . Postdoc E: Interesting . Grad B: But I think Professor D: The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D Grad B: Yep . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: and they communicate with each other ? And then  You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that  I mean , basically there wouldn't be any  l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . If you had three or four it 's  Yeah . PhD A: Ooo ! Grad B: That 's on my web pages . PhD A: Network ! Grad B: Yeah . Postdoc E: Interesting . Grad B: Though  All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , Postdoc E: Interesting . Grad B: I mean , not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of um multi - band as well . Postdoc E: Hmm . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: So it 's  it would be neat . Postdoc E: Ah ! PhD A: I still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then Grad B: But  I think Postdoc E: Well , you could have strips that you stick to your clothing . Grad B: in terms of PhD A: Yeah ! Grad B: Yeah . PhD A: Hats ? Grad B: In terms of the research  th research , it 's really  it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .

PhD A: That is cool . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: It was  yeah , it was interesting . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . And you can't just always go , \" well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up \" . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: No , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA . Postdoc E: Interesting . Grad B: But I think Professor D: The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D Grad B: Yep . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: and they communicate with each other ? And then  You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that  I mean , basically there wouldn't be any  l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two .

Grad B: Though  All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , Postdoc E: Interesting . Grad B: I mean , not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of um multi - band as well . Postdoc E: Hmm . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: So it 's  it would be neat . Postdoc E: Ah ! PhD A: I still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then Grad B: But  I think Postdoc E: Well , you could have strips that you stick to your clothing . Grad B: in terms of PhD A: Yeah ! Grad B: Yeah . PhD A: Hats ? Grad B: In terms of the research  th research , it 's really  it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do . PhD A: Shirts . Grad B: So if  if Jose is interested in that , that 's great . But if  if he 's not , that 's great too . Professor D: Yeah . PhD C: Yeah , yeah . Professor D: Yeah . Um , I  i I  i I would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still get to the end of the , uh , birthdays thing there . Grad B: Catch some tea ? Um . Professor D: So Grad B: Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out . Professor D: OK . Grad B: One is , do we need to sign new  these again ? Postdoc E: Well , it 's slightly different . So I  I would say it would be a good idea . PhD A: Are they new ? Postdoc E: Cuz  it  it 's slightly different . Grad B: Yep . PhD A: Oh . Professor D: Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to . Grad B: Yeah , I  I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed . Postdoc E: It 's slightly different . Grad B: So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form . Professor D: Ah - oh . PhD C: OK . Grad B: Um , I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing . Postdoc E: I had to make one Grad B: But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . Um and then also anonymity , how we want to anonymize the data . Uh . Postdoc E: Well , should I  I mean I have some results to present , but I mean I guess we won't have time to do that this time . But it seems like um the anonymization is uh , is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length . Professor D: Um . I mean , wha what Postdoc E: If  if we 're about to wind down , I think  what I would prefer is that we uh , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and I would like to present the results that I have on the overlaps . PhD A: We still have to do this , too , right ? Professor D: Right . PhD A: Digits ? Professor D: Right . Grad B: No - well , we don't have to do digits . Professor D: Well , why don't we  Uh , so @ @ OK . @ @  It sounds like u uh , there were  there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about . Why don't we just take a couple minutes to  to briefly  do them , and then  and then  and then  and then  and then we Grad B: OK , go ahead , Jane . Postdoc E: I 'd  Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results . e Could I do that next week maybe ? Professor D: OK . Oh , yeah . Sure . Postdoc E: OK , that 's what I 'm asking . Professor D: Oh yeah , yeah . Postdoc E: And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's  that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a  you know , more that just a minute . Professor D: We could s Grad B: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: I really do think that , because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself , you and I have discussed it previously , and there are different ways that people approach it , e and I think we should Grad B: Alright . We 're  we 're just  We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with  once we decide how to do it Postdoc E: Well , OK . Grad B: going and dealing with it . Postdoc E: It 's just  Yeah . OK . I  I 'll give you the short version , but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes . Grad B: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: OK , so  the  the short thing is um , we have uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings . Those we won't be able to change . If someone says \" Hey , Roger so - and - so \" . Grad B: Right . Postdoc E: So that 's gonna stay that person 's name . Grad B: Yep . Postdoc E: Now , in terms of like the transcript , the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name , and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says \" Hey Roger \" or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? Grad B: No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping . Postdoc E: OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned . PhD A: I don't Grad B: No . Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we don't want Postdoc E: I  I don't think you understood what I  what I said . Grad B: OK . Postdoc E: So  uh , so in  within the context of an utterance , someone says \" So , Roger , what do you think ? \" OK . Then , uh , it seems to me that  Well , maybe I  uh it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that . PhD A: Right , you don't wanna do that . Grad B: We don't  we wanna  we ha we want the transcript to be \" Roger \" . PhD A: Yeah . Grad B: Because if we made the  the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that . Postdoc E: OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then  and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's  who 's the addressee and all , then to have \" Roger \" be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was \" Roger \" be \" Frank \" , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . Grad B: Oh . Ugh ! That 's a good point . Postdoc E: Now , if you want to , you know , I mean , in some cases , I  I  I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except Professor D: Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . Postdoc E: And  and I  cer and I  So , I mean , the question then becomes one level back . Um , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? Well , on the one hand , uh , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions , um and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to  they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like   OK . So , maybe , uh , maybe that 's enough protection . On the other hand , this is a small  this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the  from the first name . However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names . Grad B: Right . PhD C: Mmm . Postdoc E: So , is it really , um   You know ? Grad B: Ugh ! Postdoc E: Now , in terms of like  so I  I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name . Grad B: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: Now , there , the Human Subjects Committee is very precise . You don't wanna mention subjects by name in published reports . Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a  in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . And someone who looked Professor D: You can go , you know , uh , \" Z \"  uh , for instance . Postdoc E: Yeah , exactly . Doesn't matter if Professor D: Uh . Um , yeah , I mean , t it doesn't  I mean , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in  in the  in the transcript . Postdoc E: That 's the same thing you saw . Grad B: OK . Professor D: Uh , I think  you don't wanna have their full name to be uh , listed . Postdoc E: Yeah , and  and in the form that they sign , it does say \" your first name may arise in the course of the meetings \" . Grad B: Yeah . Professor D: And so PhD A: Well Professor D: Yeah . So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , uh , uh , \" Frank said this \" and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's \" Frank colon \" . Postdoc E: Or \" your name \" . Grad B: Yeah , shoot ! Professor D: Right ? Postdoc E: Yeah , and  and  you know , even more i i uh , immediate than that just being able to , uh  Well , it just seems like to track  track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important . Grad B: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: S i You know , \" You raised the point , So - and - so \" , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who \" you \" was . Grad B: Shoot ! Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: I  I 'm thinking too much . Postdoc E: And ac  and actually you remember  furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , Professor D: Yeah , I was too . Yeah . Postdoc E: and  and it was  and we made the decision that was kind of artificial . Well , I mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . Grad B: Yep . Well , I would sug I  I  don't wanna change the names in the transcript , PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point . Postdoc E: Misleading . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: You 're right , this is going to require more thought . Professor D: Yeah . L let me just back up this to make a  a brief comment about the , uh , what we 're covering in the meeting . Uh I realize when you 're doing this that uh  I mean , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . Uh , and so , uh  and so I was proceeding some somewhat at random , frankly . So I think what would be helpful would be uh , i and I 'll  I 'll mention this to  to Liz and Andreas too , that um , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any  any , uh , uh , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll  I 'll take the role of organizing them uh , into  into the agenda , Postdoc E: OK . Sure . Professor D: but I 'd be very pleased to have everyone else  completely make up the agenda . I 've no desire to   to make it up , but if  if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my  my guesses , and  and uh , and i ye yeah , I  I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to  I mean , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and   and so it 's   There 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on . Grad B: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: Oh , it 's not a problem . Not a problem . Yeah . I just  I just couldn't do it in two minutes . Grad B: How will we  how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ? Do you know what I 'm saying ? PhD A: \" The person who 's doing the transcript  \"  The IBM people ? Grad B: Yeah . I mean , so so  how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ? Postdoc E: How do you mean , who  what they 're  who they 're talking about ? Grad B: I mean , so if I 'm saying in a meeting , \" oh and Bob , by the way , wanted  wanted to do so - and - so \" , Postdoc E: How do you mean ? PhD A: They 're just gonna write \" Bob \" on it or do @ @ Grad B: if you 're doing  Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write \" Bob \" . And so . If you 're  if you 're doing discourse analysis , Postdoc E: They won't be able to change it themselves . Professor D: What ar how are they gonna do any of this ? Grad B: Yeah , really . Postdoc E: Well , I  I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them . Professor D: I mean , they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker I mean I  I PhD A: They can't do that . PhD C: Yeah , I think Grad B: Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity . Grad B: because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person . and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions . Professor D: So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words . Grad B: Yep . Postdoc E: Oh .  I think that  My understanding from Yen Is it Yen - Ching ? Is that how you pronounce her name ? Professor D: Uh  Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah . Postdoc E: Oh , uh Yu - Ching ? Yu - Ching ? Grad B: y Yu - Ching . Postdoc E: was that um , they will  that they will adopt the  part of the conventions that  that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down . But , you know , h they won't know these people , so I think it 's  Well , they 'll  they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified to them  So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of  of their labeling the speakers . We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case . Professor D: And it  and it may very well be  I mean , since they 're not going to sit there and  and  and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the  eh the  the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . Postdoc E: Yeah . Professor D: And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . Postdoc E: You know  Uh - huh . You know , that would be a very practical solution on their part . PhD C: Yeah . It 's a good idea . Professor D: Yeah . Postdoc E: And  and  but then we would need to label it . Grad B: Yeah we  we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah , I think Postdoc E: And that 's OK . Postdoc E: Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: So . But I mean that doesn't  This doesn't answer the  the question . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: But that Postdoc E: That 'd be very efficient . Grad B: The p It 's a good point , \" which  what do you do for discourse tracking ? \" PhD C: Because y y you don't know to know , eh  you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the  of the speakers . You only eh want to know Grad B: Hmm . For  for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do . Professor D: Well , you do . PhD C: Ah , for discourse , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . If  if  if  if someone says , uh , \" what  what is Jose doing ? \" and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding . PhD C: Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , Grad B: Ugh ,  that 's a problem . Professor D: Uh , so . Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit . PhD A: That would be hard . Postdoc E: Well , people are very flexible . You know ? I mean , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , uh , @ @  uh , he  he  i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and  and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was  was unable to do the tracking . PhD A: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . So , people are really flexible . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting  Or , you I think said ,  you know , or s Liz , said something about um , uh , \" is Mari gonna use the equipment ? \" I mean , how would you say that ? Postdoc E: Yeah ? PhD A: I mean , you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef Grad B: if you wanted to anonymize . PhD C: Yeah .  Yeah , is Professor D: \" Is you know who up in you know where ? \" PhD A: Yeah . Yeah . Grad B: Mm - hmm . Professor D: Right ? Use the"}

Professor D: So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words . Grad B: Yep . Postdoc E: Oh .  I think that  My understanding from Yen Is it Yen - Ching ? Is that how you pronounce her name ? Professor D: Uh  Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah . Postdoc E: Oh , uh Yu - Ching ? Yu - Ching ? Grad B: y Yu - Ching . Postdoc E: was that um , they will  that they will adopt the  part of the conventions that  that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down . But , you know , h they won't know these people , so I think it 's  Well , they 'll  they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified to them  So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of  of their labeling the speakers . We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case . Professor D: And it  and it may very well be  I mean , since they 're not going to sit there and  and  and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the  eh the  the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . Postdoc E: Yeah . Professor D: And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . Postdoc E: You know  Uh - huh . You know , that would be a very practical solution on their part . PhD C: Yeah . It 's a good idea . Professor D: Yeah . Postdoc E: And  and  but then we would need to label it . Grad B: Yeah we  we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah , I think Postdoc E: And that 's OK . Postdoc E: Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: So . But I mean that doesn't  This doesn't answer the  the question . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: But that Postdoc E: That 'd be very efficient . Grad B: The p It 's a good point , \" which  what do you do for discourse tracking ? \" PhD C: Because y y you don't know to know , eh  you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the  of the speakers . You only eh want to know Grad B: Hmm . For  for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do . Professor D: Well , you do . PhD C: Ah , for discourse , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . If  if  if  if someone says , uh , \" what  what is Jose doing ? \" and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding . PhD C: Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , Grad B: Ugh ,  that 's a problem . Professor D: Uh , so . Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit . PhD A: That would be hard . Postdoc E: Well , people are very flexible . You know ? I mean , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , uh , @ @  uh , he  he  i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and  and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was  was unable to do the tracking . PhD A: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . So , people are really flexible . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting  Or , you I think said ,  you know , or s Liz , said something about um , uh , \" is Mari gonna use the equipment ? \" I mean , how would you say that ? Postdoc E: Yeah ? PhD A: I mean , you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef Grad B: if you wanted to anonymize . PhD C: Yeah .  Yeah , is Professor D: \" Is you know who up in you know where ? \" PhD A: Yeah . Yeah . Grad B: Mm - hmm . Professor D: Right ? Use the PhD A: I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , plus we 'd have to tell everybody else . Grad B: Yeah , darn ! I mean , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names . Postdoc E: Well , it PhD C: Yeah . Grad B: but then , again that kills your discourse analysis . PhD A: Right . Postdoc E: Uh - huh . PhD A: Yeah . Grad B: Ugh ! Professor D: Yeah . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Yeah . PhD A: I  I think the  I think  I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . Postdoc E: That 's  that 's the issue . Grad B: Well , but that but that  as I said , that  that  that works great for the acoustics , but it  it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse . Postdoc E: Well . PhD A: Why ? Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . Grad B: Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus  their  name that they 're being referred to . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: Yeah . Th - Bec PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two Grad B: Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and PhD A: Why do you have to know his name ? Professor D: OK , so suppose someone says , \" well I don't know if I really heard what  uh , what Jose said . \" PhD A: Yeah . PhD C: Yeah . Professor D: And then , Jose responds . PhD A: Yeah . Professor D: And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it . But it doesn't say \" Jose \" , it says \" speaker - five \" . PhD A: OK . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Professor D: So  uh  u PhD A: Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word \" Jose \" in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded . Professor D: Right . Grad B: Someone who 's doing discourse would wanna do that . Professor D: And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says \" speaker - five \" there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose , Grad B: And that violates our privacy . Professor D: and if were gonna do that we might as well  give them \" Jose \"  say it was \" Jose \" . PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Grad B: And that violates our privacy issue . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . Yeah . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: Now , I  I think that we have these two phases in the  in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI . Professor D: Yeah . Postdoc E: And within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not uh change the  to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to . Grad B: Mm - hmm . Postdoc E: And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . But I  but I don that 's  that 's a long way from now and  and it 's a matter of  between now and then of d of deciding how Grad B: Making some decisions ? Postdoc E: i i it  You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the um  the audio , and just put in brackets \" speaker - one \" . Grad B: Yeah . For the public one . PhD C: the ? ? Grad B: You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . PhD C: Yeah . Postdoc E: You know . Grad B: One that 's public and one  one that requires licensing . And so the licensed one would  w we could  it would be a sticky limitation . Postdoc E: Uh - huh . Grad B: You know , like  Well , we can talk about that later . Postdoc E: I think that 's risky . I think that the public should be the same . I think that when we do that world release , it should be the same . Professor D: I  I agree . I  I agree with Jane . Postdoc E: For a bunch of reasons , legal . Professor D: I  I think that we  we have a  need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and Postdoc E: But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important . PhD A: Well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any um  For example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , you know Grad B: Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to  still have it useful . because for discourse you don't need the audio . Right ? So you could bleep out the names in the audio . PhD A: Mm - hmm . Grad B: and use the anonymized one through the transcript . PhD A: But if you release both Professor D: Uh . Postdoc E: Excuse me . We  we do need audio for discourse . Grad B: But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names . Professor D: She  No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said \" Jose \" in their  in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it . Grad B: Right . But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said \" Jose \" that you could replace it with \" speaker - seven \" . Professor D: Oh I see . I see . Postdoc E: Yeah . But I   I also wanna say that people Grad B: And then it wouldn't meet  match the audio anymore . But it would be still useful for the Postdoc E: Uh - huh . PhD A: But if both of those are publically available Postdoc E: Yeah . That 's good . Grad B: But they  Right . Professor D: And th and the other thing is if  if  if Liz were here ,  what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , Postdoc E: Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated . Professor D: and so ,  uh , Postdoc E: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor D: yeah . Sorry . Postdoc E: I think we have to think about w @ @  how . I think that this can't be decided today . Grad B: Yeah , OK , good point . Postdoc E: But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time . Professor D: Yeah . Grad B: I didn't think  when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is . PhD C: OK . Professor D: OK . Yeah , a lot of these things are . Grad B: Discourse . Postdoc E: Well it  Discourse , you know  Also I wanted to make the point that  that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript . Grad B: Yeah , ab absolutely . Oh , yeah , sure . Postdoc E: It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , and then you come directly into this  confronting this problem . PhD A: Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse , Postdoc E: So . PhD A: and then , we wouldn't have to worry about it . PhD C: OK . Postdoc E: Yeah , we should just market it to non - English speaking countries . PhD C: OK . Professor D: Uh , maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name . Grad B: Did you read the paper on Eurospeech ? Postdoc E: We could have little labels . I  I  I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again , which is everyone has like \" Mister White \" , \" Mister Pink \" ,  \" Mister Blue \" . PhD A: Mister White . Grad B: Yeah . Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ? They were di they they had the utterances . and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards . PhD A: But  so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous Grad B: Everything was in the same order , but they were  the individual syll  syllables were played backwards . And you could listen to it ,  and it would sound the same . PhD A: What did it sound like ? Grad B: People had no difficulty in interpreting it . So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it . Professor D: Oh , well that 's  there 's an easy way to do that . Jus - jus just play it all backwards . Grad B: Oh right . The speech recognizer 's totally symmetric , isn't it . Professor D: What , what does the speech recognizer care ? Grad B: Ah , anyway . Professor D: Um , Postdoc E: Oh , do we do digits ? Or  ? What do we do ? Grad B: Uh  OK , we 'll quickly do digits . Professor D: Let 's do digits . Yeah , we  we  we already missed the party . Postdoc E: Or do we just quit ? Grad B: OK . Professor D: So . Postdoc E: Yeah . Grad B: OK , go off here . PhD A: I think it would be fun sometime to read them with different intonations . like as if you were talking like , \" nine eight six eight seven ? \" Postdoc E: Well , you know , in the  in the one I transcribed , I did find a couple instances   I found one instance of contrastive stress , where it was like the string had a  li So it was like \" nine eight two four , nine nine two four \" . PhD A: Oh , really . So they were like looking ahead , Postdoc E: And PhD A: huh ? Postdoc E: Well , they differed . I mean , at that  that session I did feel like they did it more as sentences . But , um , sometimes people do it as phone numbers .  I mean , I 've  I  am sort of interested in  in  And sometimes , you know , I s And I  I never know . When I do it , I  I ask myself what I 'm doing each time . PhD A: Yeah , yeah . Grad B: Yep . PhD A: Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this Postdoc E: and I PhD A: They may as well throw in some interesting intonations . Grad B: Well , except , Postdoc E: I like your question intonation . Grad B: yeah . Postdoc E: That 's very funny . I haven't heard that one ."}

Therefore, the team decided to make a special remote control for elderly people. The team also decided to keep the usability simple and stand out by just looks of it.", "relevant_text": "Marketing: Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Yes . Marketing: Okay it was uh uh uh um um  a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the  uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements . Project Manager: The last point is quite an interesting Marketing: Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . Project Manager: So Marketing: Um Martijn alr already said it . Project Manager: if we  Yeah . Marketing: And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but  I don't think it's uh Project Manager: Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top , Marketing: reachable . Project Manager: then you're you're Marketing: Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you  clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly . User Interface: Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . Marketing: Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the  thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours TV or something . I don't  We we haven't  Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . Okay , last page . Marketing: Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an LCD on the remote control . We already thought about that . Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical . And older people uh want to spend uh more money .  But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . Project Manager: So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . Marketing: But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? Project Manager: People . So yeah , so we just can skip the LCD r on the remote control , Marketing: I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: because  Yeah . Marketing: because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . Project Manager: It's too  Okay . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Um then  I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's  not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I   If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise . Project Manager: Because it's too expensive . Yeah , probably . Marketing: Yeah , only only for television uh  On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . User Interface: Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it . Marketing: Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a  a new product . We have to be um  Yeah . One of a kind , I think . Project Manager: So it has to look uh uh uh unique , User Interface: Unique . Marketing: The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style . Project Manager: but  Yeah . User Interface: Yeah , I reckon Project Manager: But old people are not looking for that . User Interface: Uh I think mm Project Manager: Not really . User Interface: Uh Industrial Designer: Yeah . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Yeah , Project Manager: Okay . Yeah . Marketing: to k to keep it simple when you User Interface: But uh we also have to stand out , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Sorry I thought about it , yes . User Interface: 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape , Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . User Interface: so Marketing: Okay , this was uh my presentation . Project Manager: Thanks . Industrial Designer: Okay . Marketing: I don't Project Manager: So Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Paul , you can do the next one if you want . Marketing: You can ask some questions or something . User Interface: Okay . Yeah well  Uh . Project Manager: It's on the on the uh net net uh thing , User Interface: There it is . Project Manager: isn't it ? User Interface: Okay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't  that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used . Project Manager: So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or User Interface: Yeah , I have it on the next page . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: to find out . But there is already in a one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to  . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh  Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your Industrial Designer: Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . Or not ? Project Manager: Maybe i maybe it's too complicated , User Interface: No y Project Manager: but not sure  . User Interface: Well Project Manager: It's a good idea , but User Interface: it's  It was just a thought . So I'm , I u  I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? User Interface: Well uh Project Manager: Uh User Interface: what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six . Industrial Designer: Yeah ? User Interface: So uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the Industrial Designer: Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel . User Interface: Well if you said a favourite Industrial Designer: Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and Project Manager: Uh mayb for me it's User Interface: Well i Project Manager: If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never . User Interface: Never ? Oh . Industrial Designer: No , neither do I . Project Manager: So User Interface: Oh are you ? Project Manager: And User Interface: Okay now , m maybe not . Project Manager: If I don't do it , maybe old people User Interface: No , maybe elderly people uh . Right . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno . User Interface: They don't like new features . So maybe not . Marketing: Mm-hmm . User Interface: Um well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable Project Manager: It's not , it's still not  It's not anymore n uh User Interface: when  Not anymore for TV . User Interface: Right , on off .  I dunno , miss  Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for TV . Marketing: Um Project Manager: Just on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need . User Interface: Is Industrial Designer: Uh uh the p uh next and previous . Previous I know , but next channel ? User Interface: Just the channel um uh  What I mean is uh Industrial Designer: I don't thi Marketing: Forward . Industrial Designer: Li like a web browser , User Interface: Six seven eight or five . Industrial Designer: so  Oh , okay . Project Manager: Just very simple . Industrial Designer: But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . Like a web browser back button . User Interface: Um I dunno . Project Manager: Uh  Yeah , User Interface: I don't have  Uh I did Project Manager: I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people . User Interface: Yeah , Marketing: No . Uh User Interface: I don't think you use that . Y only when you want to go to Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . User Interface: Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time . Project Manager: And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Normally you can press one , zero or User Interface: Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh Project Manager: A ten plus or User Interface: Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: To just keep it simple and standard uh features . Industrial Designer: Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh  Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people User Interface: Uh yeah mayb Marketing: It gets some seconds . User Interface: But I think that's in the TV as well . That's how the uh the TV TV handles it . But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes . Industrial Designer: Oh okay . Yeah . Marketing: Yeah , it's it's no it's not a User Interface: So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . Industrial Designer: Yeah , but that's th mm Marketing: It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the TV um do one two . It's the TV who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . Industrial Designer: Okay . User Interface: So if you have a universal TV controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that  And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and Industrial Designer: Yeah .

Industrial Designer: Yeah , but that's th mm Marketing: It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the TV um do one two . It's the TV who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . Industrial Designer: Okay . User Interface: So if you have a universal TV controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that  And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager: But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f Marketing: It's only for television now . User Interface: So I I don't think so . Project Manager: No . User Interface: Uh I just thought of another one . Marketing: No . User Interface: Most things in modern TVs are also on the menu . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: So you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh  But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: so you have Industrial Designer: I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button . User Interface: four arrows . Industrial Designer: Because you n almost never use menu button . User Interface: Yeah , okay , Industrial Designer: So User Interface: but um Project Manager: Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to User Interface: Yeah , a mute button . Yes . Project Manager: Maybe , not User Interface: Don't think so . Project Manager: I don't know where where you have to put it . User Interface: Yeah well , User Interface: that's that's  I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use . Project Manager: Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right . User Interface: And later we can d uh do the design . Industrial Designer: Okay . User Interface: Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic  Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our TV controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . Project Manager: Yeah . Does it have to be  Uh it has to be uh with different colours User Interface: Um  I dunno . Different colours um Project Manager: or Marketing: Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow Project Manager: It's like a iMac or something . Marketing: or Project Manager: Just to make it Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . User Interface: Yeah . Well why not ? Or  Yeah . Marketing: That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion . Project Manager: But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it User Interface: Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . Project Manager: Oh , you just  I dunno what happened . User Interface: Oh . User Interface: Who ? Project Manager: Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . Just User Interface: They they're uh designed very well . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . You think you can't make a TV controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: But uh well , I think that's a good example . Project Manager: Okay , Marketing: Okay . Project Manager: we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it . User Interface: Okay , sorry . Project Manager: Is it fin Are you finished ? User Interface: Well uh Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything . Industrial Designer: Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um  Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh  Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh  And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the TV . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things Project Manager: So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ? Industrial Designer: but  Yeah . I I think so . User Interface: Uh j Is Industrial Designer: I I'm not sure if it's the same thing . Project Manager: Yeah , it's  I think it's usable . User Interface: Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? Marketing: Yeah , that's active . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Or just a green one , User Interface: So Project Manager: because it's  If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green . User Interface: Yeah . Maybe uh Marketing: I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh Project Manager: Yeah , that's right . Industrial Designer: Yeah , when you press it . Project Manager: But if you Industrial Designer: So Marketing: I it's it's just uh the the Project Manager: Red's l shows up like something's wrong , Industrial Designer: Two ? Project Manager: and green is like it's okay , you press the button . Marketing: Mm . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno . User Interface: Maybe depends on uh Industrial Designer: Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red . Project Manager: Yeah , I know . User Interface: Yes . Industrial Designer: So Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay , we make it red . User Interface: But maybe Industrial Designer: So User Interface: Well Industrial Designer: I know . User Interface: we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well . Project Manager: You have to  The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . Uh that's cool . Industrial Designer: I I think uh the batteries will be uh  a little User Interface: Uh   Oh , Marketing: Empty . User Interface: maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh Project Manager: No , we have a recharger in it , so User Interface: Oh . Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . Project Manager: If we can still make that then Industrial Designer: Uh maybe . User Interface: Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red . User Interface: It's just to indicate something's on . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low . Project Manager: But it's cool if it was green . User Interface: Yeah . It's it's not very important , Project Manager: Green or red or whatever , it is cool . User Interface: so yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working . User Interface: So mm Industrial Designer: And uh the receptor in the TV senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the TVs . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the  Otherwise it won't work . User Interface: So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh Industrial Designer: No . I I uh  The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to User Interface: Okay . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: An automatically search function for each television , or something . Industrial Designer: That are working . Yeah , or  I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there . User Interface: Well , I I use a universal uh remote control , Marketing: Uh I kno User Interface: and  list of all the TVs you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , so it works on your TV . Industrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay . Marketing: Oh , I have a modern one . Marketing: And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it , Industrial Designer: Ah okay . Marketing: and then it's okay . So you don't have to search for your television or your code . Industrial Designer: Okay . Marketing: It uh search uh the pattern for itself . User Interface: Okay , Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah . User Interface: so we use that . Industrial Designer: So it uh  We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to Marketing: Yes . User Interface: Yep . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: I just say  Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking  There's just a short Industrial Designer: Uh okay . Well uh y you have this chip . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: But uh ma basically for uh brands of TV these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one TV it go go to one . And on the other TV it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . Marketing: Changing the signal . Industrial Designer: And um  What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so  And then he saves that setting Project Manager: Okay . Yeah ."}

I don't think so , Industrial Designer: No , Project Manager: but Industrial Designer: and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . Marketing: No . Project Manager: Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Uh . Project Manager: We definitely should use it . Um Industrial Designer: Hmm . Project Manager: Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting . Marketing: Okay . Industrial Designer: Oh . Mm . User Interface: Okay , that's  It changes things . Project Manager: I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well . Project Manager: So does it make some decision about that ?

User Interface: That's important I think and Marketing: LCD doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .

No , it's not User Interface: Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . Industrial Designer: No . User Interface: So , but uh  Yeah . What other features can we put in ? Industrial Designer: Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the  Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . Marketing: But uh some of you had uh something to read about um  uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ?

No , it's not User Interface: Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . Industrial Designer: No . User Interface: So , but uh  Yeah . What other features can we put in ? Industrial Designer: Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the  Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . Marketing: But uh some of you had uh something to read about um  uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ? Industrial Designer: I didn't read Marketing: That's very  That's fancy . That's cool . User Interface: It's very fashion . Industrial Designer: I didn't read any Marketing: Twelve and you've got twelve . Industrial Designer: b Yeah . Yeah okay . User Interface: Mm . Industrial Designer: I I know . Marketing: Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . Industrial Designer: Mm . Marketing: That should be cool . Project Manager: Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . But Marketing: If it's possible , Industrial Designer: Yeah , Project Manager: I don't think it's very expensive actually . Industrial Designer: I don't know . Marketing: I dunno . I didn't read it . User Interface: Mm . Project Manager: Why should it ? User Interface: Yeah , I think it's Marketing: Uh if i if i Project Manager: You only have a microphone in it . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: I didn't have information about that . Industrial Designer: But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or Project Manager: Nah , maybe Marketing: Ah that's a problem , but Industrial Designer: And and uh w Yeah ? Marketing: Uh only in English . Only in English I think . User Interface: What  But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh  Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but User Interface: uh one to have in channel one ? Marketing: No , that  Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do  do we do it ? User Interface: Yeah , Marketing: It's more if we if we do it . User Interface: I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at . Industrial Designer: And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: or Project Manager: Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . User Interface: Is Project Manager: It  We have short time to to put it on the market , Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno . Project Manager: so that  We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . User Interface: Mm  Yeah well Marketing: Okay . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think so . Project Manager: We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . Marketing: Yeah , and uh and uh User Interface: It's Marketing: In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: I d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . Industrial Designer: And and Project Manager: Yeah . I think so . Industrial Designer: Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh Marketing: Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the TV turns uh to one . Industrial Designer: the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay . Marketing: Yeah , User Interface: Yeah . Well yeah , Marketing: it's not uh User Interface: that's the right command . And then you have to say uh TV channel one , or something . Not just one , Industrial Designer: But  Hmm yeah , TV one . User Interface: but Marketing: Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition . User Interface: Well I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: So Marketing: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: we have to make some decisions . So Marketing: Okay , no speech recognition . Project Manager: you can see on the uh  So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do User Interface: Yeah , I think so . Project Manager: If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ? Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's good . Project Manager: Okay , we just take that one . User Interface: Yep . Project Manager: And what else , we have User Interface: Also the one in the dark . So uh  It lights up when it's dark ? Project Manager: Yeah , but it's  Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . User Interface: I didn't Project Manager: If you push something , it it all lights up . User Interface: Okay . Marketing: Yeah . Yeah yeah , User Interface: Yeah , but um Marketing: it it mustn't work all the time . User Interface: Yes , that's what I mean . Marketing: It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . Project Manager: Or you can switch it on or something . Marketing: So if you User Interface: Or maybe when you Marketing: No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . User Interface: yeah . It lights up all . Project Manager: Yeah , that's right . You have to  Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah . User Interface: Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah . Project Manager: And do we use a a  Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac ,  if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control . User Interface: Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod . Industrial Designer: Mm , maybe it's a good idea . User Interface: Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Like uh phones . Marketing: Oh yeah . Project Manager: Different colours . Okay , Industrial Designer: Hmm . Project Manager: so y you just make it th through  You look through it ? Marketing: A see-through . Mm , that's cool . User Interface: Yeah . Uh as an option maybe . Project Manager: Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top , User Interface: It's the standard Project Manager: and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . User Interface: Yeah , uh  Yeah , Marketing: But you have  You had a lot of different buttons . User Interface: we but we don't  We don't really have any complicated buttons . Industrial Designer: Hmm . Project Manager: Yeah , maybe you have you have to  Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . User Interface: Yeah okay , but  Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little Project Manager: O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it . User Interface: No , I don't need don't need  Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . Industrial Designer: Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext . Project Manager: Yeah , that's right . User Interface: I use teletext as well . Industrial Designer: So uh Marketing: No , I use te teletext every day , I think . Industrial Designer: Hmm . Okay . Project Manager: Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay . User Interface: Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , Marketing: Mm . User Interface: I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: 'Cause  simple buttons . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: If you put one above it , it's clear . Project Manager: Okay . So that's it for toda for  We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um User Interface: How long is lunch break ? Project Manager: So yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it . You get your meal and everything , so Marketing: Trendwatching . Okay . That's fine . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Yo . User Interface: Okay . User Interface: Bye . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah ."}

Project Manager: So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay . User Interface: Good . Project Manager: So you can show your prototype if you want to . User Interface: Together ? Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , it's  Let's do it together . User Interface: I'll give comments . Industrial Designer: Okay . Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it .  Uh the material should be hard plastic . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements . Uh we have  The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel . Project Manager: Okay , cool . Industrial Designer: And this is the the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: And the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger . Marketing: Means Industrial Designer: So you hold it like this in your right hand and Project Manager: Mm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? User Interface: Speech recognition . Project Manager: Yeah , speech recognition . Just  Only one button to say it's on or off . User Interface: Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . Industrial Designer: Uh I dunno . User Interface: Um so I've Industrial Designer: Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it . User Interface: Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . Project Manager: So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . User Interface: Yeah , you can  put 'em all on the back . That's for sure . Industrial Designer: Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: That's uh Industrial Designer: Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . Marketing: Okay . User Interface: We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But  You have a lot of room if you can slide it open . Project Manager: Yeah , you can put it separate . User Interface: You  Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So  But it's enough room . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh User Interface: Uh well Industrial Designer: You wrote this , so . User Interface: Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . That was the the most important thing . User Interface: So uh the best  place , the best reach place  Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's  basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know . Industrial Designer: Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . User Interface: Okay yeah , they Marketing: But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes . Industrial Designer: Mm yeah . User Interface: Yeah okay . That's that's below that then . Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . User Interface: It's uh twelve buttons . Industrial Designer: just so you get that . Marketing: Okay , but   It's rather important . User Interface: Yeah okay , just we just missed that . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: But um I'll just uh  I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular . Um  The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you   That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh  in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it . Marketing: Okay . User Interface: And also in the num-pads , there's also colour  light behind it . Project Manager: And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? User Interface: So when you pre Yeah . Project Manager: How do you want to implement that ? Just on the  Maybe on the second level as well ? User Interface: We're going to implement . Yeah . Mm just a little Industrial Designer: Yeah , these are just basic functions , so Marketing: Ah . Industrial Designer: All the non-basic are in Project Manager: Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Okay . Um Marketing: Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . Industrial Designer: Okay , maybe we use this button for the Marketing: That function must be  Yeah , maybe  Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions . User Interface: Yeah , Project Manager: Yeah , as well . User Interface: I um Project Manager: Just make make a User Interface: To your video device . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: A second level ? Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Like a a new blank one or  Or just here ? Project Manager: No no , just on  Down there . User Interface: Is i Ah okay . Project Manager: So uh Industrial Designer: Okay . Yeah . Marketing: And h how does the second level come out ? Project Manager: Just uh if you s Marketing: Uh it slides uh along ? User Interface: Um slides I think . Project Manager: Yeah , y Maybe , yeah . User Interface: It's Marketing: From from the uh beneath ? Project Manager: For the bottom . User Interface: You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . Project Manager: No , you gotta slide it . User Interface: If that breaks then you're screwed . Project Manager: Yeah , it's right . User Interface: So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um Industrial Designer: So what do we need ? User Interface: Uh i the the speech functions buttons . Industrial Designer: Yeah , just Marketing: Menu ? User Interface: Menu button . With uh maybe uh arrows . So you can uh User Interface: scroll in the , navigate the menu . Um Industrial Designer: God damn it . Marketing: Scart ? User Interface: I think we can even put a   We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . Marketing: Uh yeah .

Yeah , or th or the Marketing: There's one text button I prefer . That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . User Interface: Yeah , we have that on the the text button . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Do you do you Industrial Designer: Yep . Marketing: Did you think of that ? Industrial Designer: Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then User Interface: Uh why not ? Project Manager: Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well . Marketing: Ex Yeah . Yeah . User Interface: No  Whoa Industrial Designer: Well w we thought of a text button .

Project Manager: Yeah , that's okay . User Interface: Yeah , the three stages . Yes . Industrial Designer: Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: So you can switch back from second to w first . User Interface: No , it doesn't have to turn it off . Just don't Marketing: No . Just remember where it was . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? Project Manager: Yes , that's to remember . Industrial Designer: Okay , okay . Project Manager: Yeah , but that's that's uh Marketing: But maybe it's not the way User Interface: I dunno if Project Manager: That's a functionality for the television . User Interface: Yeah , I think as well , but  Uh yeah . Marketing: Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about . Industrial Designer: Yeah mm nee uh  No , if i  uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on . User Interface: Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the Project Manager: Okay . Yeah , but you have to search every time again . User Interface: the chip . Industrial Designer: Th i Project Manager: That's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that . User Interface: Yeah , that's true . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno . Okay . User Interface: So yeah . Um do we need to fix that or Project Manager: No , that's what the television does . Marketing: Mm  most new TVs do uh collect all the pages . Industrial Designer: Yeah , those memory functions . Marketing: But uh not not every every television , so Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay , it's cool . Industrial Designer: Was uh this logo for uh volume ? Project Manager: Yeah , that's fine . Industrial Designer: Okay . So that's it ? Project Manager: Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ? Marketing: Yeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ? Industrial Designer: Mm . No no User Interface: Just like your telephone , hard plastic . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Just hard plastic . So Marketing: Okay . Project Manager: It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway . Marketing: Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh  And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? User Interface: I think just on the buttons . Industrial Designer: Uh I think just um User Interface: If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space . Marketing: Well yeah . That's too much place .

Project Manager: Yeah , but that's unnecessary . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: What do I think is necessary necessary item ? Marketing: It's pretty cool . If you slide it open ,  it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but  I don't know if it's reachable . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Of course it's reachable . Project Manager: It doesn't make Marketing: Then we do it . User Interface: Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . Industrial Designer: Hmm . User Interface: So you can see what's really there . Not just not re on the buttons or something . Project Manager: No . Yeah . User Interface: Just a green light or some blue light . To light it all up . Marketing: Yeah , Project Manager: But  Yeah . Mayb Okay . Marketing: but Industrial Designer: Yeah , just backlight . Not not the buttons . User Interface: Yeah .

Project Manager: Yeah , it is one point eight three . Marketing: A perfect score .  No , I don't know . Industrial Designer: We're not too hard on ourselves .

But we didn't follow the latest trends . Industrial Designer: Yeah .  No . Yeah , you could make a a front User Interface: Mm . I think we followed the latest trends . Industrial Designer: a front that's that's like uh like a banana ,  or something . Marketing: Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh  get on my computer . User Interface: Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . Project Manager: Yeah , you get different colours . User Interface: You can different front uh Marketing: Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh Project Manager: So Industrial Designer: Like a a f banana kind of front . Marketing: Oh yeah . But spongy will never be . Industrial Designer: No . Marketing: So we give ourself a three or something . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Oh . Marketing: Okay . Project Manager: So that's eleven . Marketing: That's uh Project Manager: It's Marketing: What's the average ? Industrial Designer: Eleven divided by six . Project Manager: Yeah , it is one point eight three . Marketing: A perfect score .  No , I don't know . Industrial Designer: We're not too hard on ourselves . User Interface: This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up . Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay . Marketing: And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep . User Interface: To call . Project Manager: Oh yeah , that's still User Interface: Um Marketing: Call Industrial Designer: Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep . Project Manager: Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one . User Interface: Okay . No no , I want that in . Marketing: That's  Yeah , but it Industrial Designer: But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . Marketing: No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable . Industrial Designer: If you do uh Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ? Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . Marketing: It's  uh Project Manager: So I just got a financial um User Interface: Yes uh . Project Manager: You s  saved it or Marketing: Yeah . I did save it . Project Manager: No . Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me . It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . Industrial Designer: Mm  okay . Marketing: That's fine . Industrial Designer: But uh is uh uh Project Manager: So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . Industrial Designer: Okay . Project Manager: So that's both . Marketing: Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three . Project Manager: Yeah , and single curved curved . Industrial Designer: But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or Project Manager: No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be  . Industrial Designer: Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? User Interface: Yeah , we can uh Project Manager: Probably . I just  The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was  I'm not sure . User Interface: Um  different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah . Project Manager: See it's  I think it's okay like this . Marketing: Special form , yeah . Project Manager: It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um  Yeah ,  okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: We get different ones , that's all . So you can put a recharger in it as well . Project Manager: But this is expensive , the sample speaker . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: This ? Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's four . Marketing: Four . It's four Euros . User Interface: Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah , that's included . Marketing: So we are User Interface: Okay , then we then we need to use it . Industrial Designer: It's kind of weird that we  we get this information now , afterwards . Because Project Manager: Yeah , no . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this  . User Interface: Damn , solar cells are uh expensive . Project Manager: So  I just want you  Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . Marketing: Okay . Project Manager: Okay . We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ? Industrial Designer: Sure . Marketing: Yes . User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: Paul , was there room for crea creativity ? Industrial Designer: Beautiful . User Interface: Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . I think uh everyone uh  already . So Industrial Designer: Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Or a different style . Industrial Designer: then there  we probably have been creative . User Interface: I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Yeah . We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: So it's creativity . Industrial Designer: Huh . Project Manager: Okay , so the leadership  Was there a leadership and User Interface: Of course there was . Project Manager: Okay . Project Manager: What do you have to say about that ? Industrial Designer: No , I think Marketing: Who was the leader ? Project Manager: I dunno . Industrial Designer: Yeah .  Just normal discussion , I think . Not User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: one leader or something . User Interface: One leader to check the time , etcetera . Industrial Designer: Yeah . And make notes . Project Manager: Yeah , I know . User Interface: So more like a secretary . Project Manager: Okay , next one . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Uh team work um  The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . We were not all  We were not um agree with every not agree with  . Marketing: Yeah yeah . We were not finished . Industrial Designer: Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just Project Manager: We're not finished . Marketing: Uh . User Interface: Uh I think we  we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . Industrial Designer: Yeah , th that's weird . Marketing: Yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . User Interface: Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would  it . Marketing: And then User Interface: We had to Industrial Designer: Hmm hmm yeah . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah , finance . Industrial Designer: So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: But the teamwork was okay . Marketing: Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh User Interface: I think uh everyone listen to each other . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . Project Manager: Yeah . 'Kay . Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . User Interface: It was Marketing: Yeah . User Interface: Just doesn't work . Project Manager: No . User Interface: Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . Marketing: Digital pen or Industrial Designer: Yeah ."}

So it's flush . Industrial Designer: and the buttons at the bottom would d User Interface: Right . Industrial Designer: so so it'll fully close flat . Project Manager: Oh right , okay , yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer: And working on the inside we've um already said  d decided on the kinetic batteries , which  actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of Project Manager: So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: 'cause it's the top part that's  okay . Industrial Designer: Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in  and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . Marketing: Or something . Industrial Designer: And then  yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: 'Kay . Project Manager: I'm under the sofa . User Interface: Ah oka Project Manager: Or , that would be too complicated . Industrial Designer: Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's  be a standard transmission with the TV using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . Project Manager: Infrared  . Industrial Designer: Um it would it would have  obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .  And uh because , obviously , all TVs use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the  on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the  we haven't  I don't think we actually put it on . Project Manager: Like here . Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , something like that . User Interface: Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here . Project Manager: Okay . Actually , no , it would be  it would have to be on the on the front . Industrial Designer: Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah . User Interface: . So when it's  even if it's open here , the signals would go  . Project Manager: Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing , Industrial Designer: So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the TV . Project Manager: yes . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah , that would make sense . Industrial Designer: And then finally um on to the interface .  The top screen , as we said , is  would be an inset um black and white LCD s touch screen User Interface: This one right here . Industrial Designer: which  yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . User Interface: . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: And now we've  we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . User Interface: Which is Project Manager: But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product Industrial Designer: No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . User Interface: No . Industrial Designer: And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , Marketing: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .  So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those  the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Marketing: The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .  Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Marketing: Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ? User Interface: Ah , it's perfect . Marketing: we're going to look at these crite So User Interface: Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market Marketing: Yes , User Interface: okay . Marketing: we're going to come to  w we'll discuss each one Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Marketing: and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . Project Manager: Okay . Marketing: Is that okay ? User Interface: 'Kay . Marketing: One is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ .  This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . Project Manager: Just write small . Marketing: Criteria and rating . Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ? User Interface: Yeah , so you can Project Manager: Yeah . That works . Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . Marketing: Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy  it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . One is true and seven is false . Project Manager: I would agree . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh  two  yeah , Marketing: I'll just go this way . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: 'Kay . Industrial Designer: two or three . Marketing: Two . Industrial Designer: No , three . Three . Marketing: Okay . Project Manager: I would say two . Marketing: Two . User Interface: I would say four . Marketing: A four , okay . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Marketing: Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right . User Interface: Almost three . Industrial Designer: Mm yeah . Marketing: Two and three quarters ? User Interface: I think yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Marketing: Okay . Two point seven five , there we go .  Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three . Industrial Designer: I'd give it a one . Marketing: Okay . Not that you're biased  in that it  the designer . Industrial Designer: No , no , not at all . Project Manager: A two . User Interface: Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? The first . Marketing: The average User Interface: Yeah , I I just  it the other way ."}

Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Okay . Or we  or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at Industrial Designer: D_ . Marketing: it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . Industrial Designer: One . Yeah . Marketing: Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's Marketing: Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? Industrial Designer: No , no , the the base colour was um  white or or like or l sort of a light blue , User Interface: White . With  for the plastic ? Uh blue . Industrial Designer: but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any  basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . Marketing: Right . User Interface: Any Marketing: So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . User Interface: Right . Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah User Interface: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Marketing: Okay . Industrial Designer: and Marketing: And the spongy feel is no problem with that . User Interface: Yeah , because you'll be having a  Because of the rubber case . Industrial Designer: No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that  otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . Marketing: Okay . In that case it's got to be a one for me . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . Marketing: Yep . Project Manager: One . Marketing: Everybody ? Okay . User Interface: One . Marketing: That part was nice and easy . User Interface: Mm . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . Industrial Designer: Mm . Marketing: I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . Industrial Designer: No . Marketing: We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ Industrial Designer: It's meant to be . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: it's meant to . Um Marketing: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: maybe because it's slightl Project Manager: with the size that we've got it's quite small , Project Manager: but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . Marketing: Mm . Project Manager: So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Right . Project Manager: It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um Marketing: Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , Marketing: A five , okay . Industrial Designer: 'cause Project Manager: Four . Marketing: Four and a four okay . User Interface: Four .

Project Manager: I don't think so . Industrial Designer: W I thin yeah , I think Marketing: We happy to go ahead ? Project Manager: I think we  yeah . I think we're set . Industrial Designer: yeah . Marketing: Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . Marketing: I know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up ? Project Manager: Don't think so .

Industrial Designer: because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the TV . Marketing: Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah . Project Manager: But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager: I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , Industrial Designer: No . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being  a plastic was being made for you . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: But people could  have anything that they wanted . Industrial Designer: Mm . User Interface: Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . Project Manager: Because of the produ Mm . User Interface: And new f television products coming up , Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: but nobody giving uh much idea to this . Like Sarah was telling , everything's Marketing: I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , User Interface: Right . Marketing: because  just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . There are innovations in that that people don't really want . Project Manager: Yes . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: Well , it's innovation for money's sake . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: The the people have to keep buying . Marketing: But forcing it onto people , Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: yeah . It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want . Project Manager: And you can't get  you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , Marketing: Mm . Mm . Project Manager: because the phones have moved on , things like that . Marketing: Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , Project Manager: Yes . Marketing: yeah . Project Manager: It's madness . Um Marketing: See I think Project Manager: In closing  There we go . Project Manager: Um  our costs are below budget with recommendations that they  the budget be increased , but I think  I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? Industrial Designer: Well . Marketing: I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . Industrial Designer: I think that was just the the physical . Project Manager: So it looks  well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: Maybe fifty percent more . Project Manager: But I think  but you were saying that that's quite Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think  yeah I don't  from the market research . Marketing: But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . I think we've done what we were required to do , Project Manager: Hmm . Marketing: and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: No . Yeah , it was Marketing: I think we've done very well to get within budget Marketing: and it still makes such an innovative item Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: that I think people are really gonna want . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: It's a shame it won't ever get made . Project Manager: Maybe it will . Marketing: Maybe it will . Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas Project Manager: Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it ."}

Sharon Davies: I would say the majority have. Nick Williams: Yes. Nick Williams: Certainly with schools, I know across Wales we've done a lot of training on adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed practice, so at least people can perhaps better understand some of the reasons why this behaviour is coming through, whereas in the past\u2014I'm thinking myself, now, as a teacher\u2014they were just difficult behaviours. I didn't really know the background to possibly why those behaviours were coming through. So, I think we are more informed as a profession. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on funding from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Sian Gwenllian AM: May I begin, maybe, with a question, generally speaking\u2014? We're all aware of the funding issues and the challenges of funding that face schools in general. So, can this lead to more exclusions, because additional learning needs have been hit in light of these challenges, and then that the side-effects of that creates more exclusions? Sharon Davies: In particular now with the new Act coming into force, that's going to place more pressure on the system. In Torfaen, we know that we have schools that are looking at their funding\u2014they are behind, and they have to make these hard choices. And sometimes, they have to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners, then, and that does place additional pressure on the schools. Sian Gwenllian AM: Is the additional learning needs sector being adversely affected, worse than\u2014? Sharon Davies: I'm not sure whether it's being worse affected, but certainly there's pressure, in particular with the new Act coming in, and that's going to place more pressure on the system. Sian Gwenllian AM: But maybe we need to spend more in light of the new Act? Sharon Davies: Yes. Nick Williams: Yes, certainly. Sian Hughes: What is your experience, then? Nick Williams: The same, really. But just sometimes, the Government doesn't think about the staff in the pupil referral units, because we've gone back to the Government to tell them, 'Right, you've provided money to school staff, but what about staff that need training\u2014perhaps more than staff in the school sector?' And in fairness, they have addressed that, but perhaps it's not at the forefront of their minds when they're thinking of providing funding to the schools. So, it's a little bit of an afterthought. But this will be needed in the future, certainly. Sian Gwenllian AM: And maybe I can ask the WLGA: are the difficulties that can arise between the money that is kept back by local authorities and the funding that goes directly to schools\u2014can that therefore affect the kind of provision that's happening from authority to authority? David Hopkins: Yes, sure. The delegation levels are already very high in most authority areas, and we've got agreements in place with the Government to make sure that more money, or as much money as possible, is devolved to schools. So, I don't think that's a direct factor. I think the factors that really affect exclusions, which is where I think the question came from: you've got the very narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment, which I think has put pressure on some schools, certainly, and headteachers have felt that\u2014sometimes excluded, or otherwise put into another school as a consequence, which is regrettable, but that's what's happened. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister has currently made some more money available, if we look at experiences that have happened in England, in particular, because there are direct parallels there with legislation, we know from those experiences that ALN funding has become increasingly under pressure\u2014there have been big issues around tribunals, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals, because they were losing them time and time again. So, there are financial pressures there, but I don't think the levels of delegation have any impact on that."}

But just the pressures coming in with the new Act et cetera could mean more expulsions. David Hopkins: It shouldn't, but it could. It's difficult to know how headteachers and governing bodies will react. If they're under pressure financially or in terms of performance measures, they will react in a particular way. Culturally, we've got to get to the point, I think, particularly with the new curriculum coming in, where we say, 'Look, forget the narrow measures that you're being judged by. We're trying to agree with partners, including Estyn and the Welsh Government, a broader range of measures.' That, in a sense, may provide opportunities for schools, and local authorities, to look more constructively at this whole area. So, that's one area, but you're right, I think the ALN legislation will put pressures on, not just local authorities and schools, but also on the post-16 sector, because we're talking now about a wider age range\u2014doing up to 25 as well. So, we've got a host of issues, I think, there to consider and work our way through. Sian Gwenllian AM: And is the fact that there's variation from term to term, from week to week sometimes, in the level of provision that a school is going to have to provide for trying to retain those pupils in mainstream schools\u2014is the fact that there is so much variation creating a specific challenge, and maybe that that leads to more exclusions? Sharon Davies: As you say, because it changes, it's difficult then to plan ahead, and from year to year and also, as you've said, within the term. Perhaps you have provision for more learners coming in or moving, and then that causes the pressure within the system, then, because you haven't planned for them, and therefore there's no spare funding there to draw on. Nick Williams: Also, in fairness to PRUs, we've been trying to work on the fact that, if children move out of school, the funding follows them. We don't want a lag in the system, because they have to meet the challenge of the pupils, but the money is still in the schools, because it's once a year that they have that funding. Sian Hughes: Okay, thank you. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. What more can be done, and by whom, to support collaborative working between schools,\u00a0PRUs and local authorities to ensure that there is a continuum of provision and support for learners? Nick Williams: Well, one of the things I think that has improved a lot is the networking within the PRU sector. We meet on a regular basis, and that's nationally. And the EOTAS group meets regionally as well. So, there's definitely a better sharing of practice. We put on some very, very good conferences as one form of professional learning. But it's also important\u2014. And we're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider, or it's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits, joint visits, to provision and also using the expertise that we do have within the sector to work more closely with our schools, and vice versa, particularly around the curriculum. And I think this is the opportunity the new curriculum provides, providing our staff have the funding to do that and the opportunities we need to be creating around that as well. But in the past, there might well have been some staff who perhaps hadn't had those school experiences and vice versa. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Can I just ask you about transition arrangements, because I know some of the issues that have arisen in my own constituency is when a pupil is in a PRU and then trying to get back into mainstream education? It isn't a clear, sort of, going from one to the other\u2014sometimes a child can find themselves at home because they're not able to get back into the school setting, the main school setting. How are you addressing that? Nick Williams: Well, again, I can only speak for ourselves. We've had a big investment of time, and there will be money and through band B, we're building a brand-new PRU provision in Swansea, which will be open in January 2021. So, we've recognised that, so that we have our staff working very closely with the schools. There's an integration through a part-time timetable back into school, and we continue to support them during that process. But then, when they're back in school, that support doesn't stop\u2014that support continues, and then there's a managed reduction in that support. And that's proven very successful. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: It sounds to me very\u2014. Yes, good\u2014. Nick Williams: But I'll be honest with you, the more challenging your learners are the ones who are coming to the end of their statutory education, your key stage 4. It is far, far more difficult when they're 15, 16 to get them back into mainstream. So, then you're looking more at how you transit, then, into further education and colleges and so on.

Because, obviously, we've had the Swansea perspective. I mean, how effective are Torfaen at reintegrating young people into mainstream education? Sharon Davies: As Nick said, it does get more difficult at key stage 4, and it's working, then, with\u2014. It comes back to that team-around-the-family approach, to ensure what is needed for that learner to go back into school, what can the school provide. It's looking at the whole package of support, then, that surrounds not just the learner but the family, whether it's transport\u2014it's looking at the whole agenda, then, to ensure that everything is in place for that learner to go back to school, where it's possible. David Hopkins: I think, Chair, at least one authority is looking at how they can best retain all pupils in the school setting, but it's early days yet for looking at that. I mean, that's an ideal, obviously, but it does mean looking at your funding constructively and carefully, and it brings\u2014. The principle is fine, but it does bring a host of other issues with it, if you see what I mean. But it's certainly a model worth looking at. It's been tried elsewhere, and we keep an eye on that, but we don't really know what the outcomes have been long term with that. Lynne Neagle AM: And which authority is that? David Hopkins: I don't think I'm allowed to say at this point. Lynne Neagle AM: Oh, okay. And where is it being tried elsewhere? In England, is it? David Hopkins: Oxfordshire. Sharon Davies: A few years ago, I used to be a primary headteacher in England, so we were looking at different models, then, at various conferences, and I believe Oxford, as a local authority\u2014they had a PRU, and they had discussions with their secondary schools, then, whether to get rid of the PRU, as such, and give the money back into schools. But they looked at a partnership within the schools, then, to say, 'Okay, you can have the money, but there's got to be terms of reference'\u2014not quite a service level agreement, but the schools worked together as a partnership, then, so that they couldn't keep moving the children around, the learners around. It's looking at how well that worked. It started off really well, but that was a few years ago, so I don't know whether it's continued now. But that was a model that, at the time, that local authority looked at to get more money into schools and to get schools, then, to have that responsibility\u2014that they didn't offload the learners elsewhere. Lynne Neagle AM: Nick, you wanted to\u2014. Nick Williams: Yes, sorry. We do something similar in Swansea. We've operated this now for almost three years, where we devolve\u2014the word is 'devolve', as opposed to 'delegate'\u2014the money to secondary schools to try and give them some extra resource to manage the process, and they have to produce an action plan, which we monitor, about how they're using that funding. But, obviously, we recognise that\u2014and it's back to your original question, the first question\u2014we still have learners, unfortunately, despite pretty effective support and provision in nearly all our schools, because of the very, very challenging behaviour we're experiencing, who do need additional and bespoke support, which in fairness the school can't provide. So, it's a mixed economy, if you like, in Swansea. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Janet. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.

Sorry, I missed that. Nick Williams: Sorry. Capacity: we just haven't got enough spaces in some cases, some year groups and so on. Obviously, given what I've said as well, and I'm sure it'd be the same for all local authorities, we've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision, if you like, the home school. So, there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable, which isn't ideal, I accept, but again, it's working with the families and the youngsters. Also, for us as well we've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion. We have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners. Sometimes, it works really well; sometimes, the learner turns around and says, 'Actually, I preferred it in my old school.' So, there's a cooling-off period as well. I think the learner voice is very important there, because\u2014. We've got to have a package, I think, that is quite wide in its offer. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. What would be the advantages or disadvantages, then, of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for providers, and for EOTAS providers to have approved status? Nick Williams: Obviously, we do do that, but we're struggling sometimes for additional provision\u2014very important around safeguarding. However, we don't want to make it too difficult, so that we haven't got any providers coming forward either. So, it's a little bit of a balancing act. But, first and foremost, safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking. But I think, then, we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision\u2014what sort of training and support they have. At the moment, that is a struggle for us, because we're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is\u2014. But, to actually offer some additional training is a challenge. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay, thank you. To what extent do local authorities know about the level of EOTAS provision that is organised by individual schools, whether in an FE college or otherwise off the school site? Nick Williams: I can only speak for Swansea. We know, as part of that plan that we ask our schools to send in, they have to put down where that provision is. And obviously, as part of the visits, as well, to the schools by the challenge advisers, the school should be monitoring that provision and quality assuring that provision. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: And how is safeguarding monitored in terms of privately run EOTAS? Independent. Nick Williams: The schools would have to make sure that\u2014 Janet Finch-Saunders AM: But is that happening, do you know? Nick Williams: Yes, because schools do take safeguarding very, very seriously. They see the importance of it. It's their prime driver in many ways. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And is there a role for local authorities in quality assuring, monitoring or evaluating the EOTAS provision organised by individual schools? Nick Williams: Yes, but a lot of the additional provision is provision we also use, in our experience. So, if it's MTP or something through the college, like a mechanics course or something like that, we're probably using it ourselves. So, it is quality assured, if you like, by two sides. Sharon Davies: In Torfaen, our secondary schools have set out their own TCP\u2014Torfaen curriculum panel\u2014which looks at alternative provision. So, you've got senior leaders there who attend those meetings. The meetings are facilitated and they're currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school is doing because, sometimes, it's worked in the past, but what they're seeing now is that it's not quite working now, and it's understanding why. Is it due to the complexity of the learners coming through? Or is it that the providers are not offering what the learners are seeking any more? So, it's looking as well at, coming back to that curriculum offer, is it the right curriculum offer for those learners? And the training of the staff, do we have the right staff? It's capacity, then. It's just quality assuring the provision. Just because it's worked in the past\u2014it's about keeping that momentum going. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And should local authorities take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition? Sharon Davies: Can I just ask what you mean by individual tuition?"}

Is it due to the complexity of the learners coming through? Or is it that the providers are not offering what the learners are seeking any more? So, it's looking as well at, coming back to that curriculum offer, is it the right curriculum offer for those learners? And the training of the staff, do we have the right staff? It's capacity, then. It's just quality assuring the provision. Just because it's worked in the past\u2014it's about keeping that momentum going. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And should local authorities take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition? Sharon Davies: Can I just ask what you mean by individual tuition? Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I suppose individual tuition in terms of each individual, I would assume that means. Sharon Davies: Okay. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I wouldn't like to think anyone was falling through\u2014 Lynne Neagle AM: I think the purpose of the question is around home tuition, yes. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Individual tuition in terms of we wouldn't want any child, if they're away from a main-school setting, to slip through the net in terms of tuition, or safeguarding even. Sharon Davies: I suppose the difficulty with home tuition is, as a local authority, we're restricted on how much access we get into the home. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Well, I appreciate that, and that's the\u2014[Inaudible.] Sharon Davies: Therefore, it's really difficult then to quality assure, because unless the families invite us in there's very little\u2014. We are restricted in that respect. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: What about if they're in a private setting? Nick Williams: If they're following a restricted timetable or whatever, because maybe they're school anxious and so on, and we're trying to get them into our provision like that, the home-tuition staff work for us. We don't use agency staff, for instance, to go in and provide a few hours of provision, or to go to the local library. So, for whatever reason their needs at the moment can't be met in a school or in approved provision, then the staff who do provide some education, or if it's for medical reasons, they work for us in the local authority. So, we're not using\u2014 Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Is that widespread around Wales? Nick Williams: I don't really know the answer to that, I'm sorry. I can only speak for Swansea. Sharon Davies: We're very similar to that. David Hopkins: Historically, there has been a general pattern, and if you're making a provision you will quality assure it, clearly. I think your question is probably about other forms of provision and how do you quality assure those."}

David Hopkins: And that's more difficult to answer, I suspect. Lynne Neagle AM: What we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority, but I think Nick has answered that now, really, if that's a consistent answer for local authorities.\u00a0Can I just ask, before we move on, in the WLGA paper, you say you're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are EOTAS and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working'. Can you expand on those concerns for the committee? Nick Williams: I think it's, you know\u2014 Lynne Neagle AM: It was the WLGA paper, actually. David Hopkins: It was a joint paper. You go on. Nick Williams: It's about getting that money following the learner and so on, and that shared ownership of the learner that the schools need to keep, because we want them reintegrated back into schools\u2014that's the aim of any provision that we put in. It's not permanent\u2014except, for certain learners, that might be the case\u2014so they're still, if you like, part and parcel of the school. I think one of your other colleagues asked about the off-rolling, if you like\u2014another term that's used\u2014of students when they get to GCSEs\u00a0so they don't count in schools' data. We're trying to very much move away from that, through the messages that we all give our schools. The messages that governors and headteachers then give to their staff. So: 'They're our learners. They're the most vulnerable learners we've got.' And for the individuals, for the families, and for society, if we can't support these learners\u2014we know the links then to crime, and the cost to us as a society as well. So, it's in all our interests to do the very best for these learners. Lynne Neagle AM: You won't get any arguments from us on that. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian has got some questions on the curriculum. Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I just want to discuss a little about the curriculum as it stands, and thinking about transferring to a new curriculum, of course. What are the challenges? I'll begin with the WLGA, in general, and ask you, in both your areas, what are the challenges to ensure that EOTAS learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum, and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them? What are the challenges associated with that? David Hopkins: In general terms\u2014. You differentiate there between EOTAS and PRUs. PRUs: clearly, we know that they are following a set curriculum; they are inspected; they are under the control of the local authorities. So, we're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there. Where home tuition is provided through the local authority, as has been discussed, again, there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving. You can't always guarantee what then happens in the home. As you say, particular things happen there, and they may not get that. But that's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle. It's more difficult where, I suspect, it's being provided by a third party that's been commissioned. The commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place; it's all about the monitoring then. But that's a very general, broad-brush answer. I couldn't give you a definitive one of what's happening across Wales. My colleagues can probably tell you what's happening in their localities, and that would be helpful. But in general: PRUs, yes, we'd be satisfied; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority, yes, we would be satisfied; other areas, we would not be able to give a definitive answer on, is my guess. Sian Gwenllian AM: And does that worry you? David Hopkins: Me? Sian Gwenllian AM: The WLGA. David Hopkins: Of course it's a concern. If you can't guarantee quality in any shape or form for a young person, it is a concern."}

Certainly, they also work with school staff as well. So, the developments are quite positive currently, but there is work to do, I agree. Sian Gwenllian AM: In terms of the how curriculum is at present, are you happy that it's being delivered? Nick Williams: To be honest, we are\u2014 Sian Gwenllian AM: In the PRUs? Nick Williams: To be honest, they are broad and balanced. They have to be broad and balanced currently. But there's working together now in terms of the new curriculum, and using the opportunity that exists now to collaborate with school staff as well. Sharon Davies: Collaboration, I think, is the answer, between the PRUs and the schools. Collaborate and have joint working to ensure that the learners have what they need. Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I can see how collaborative working with the units can work\u2014because they're under your control\u2014the problem is the other parts of the system, in a way. Nick Williams: They're not with other people all the time; they just go for something So, they would still have literacy and numeracy and Welsh\u2014that would still be provided in the PRU. So, they're not out all the time. Sian Gwenllian AM: No, it's beyond the PRUs I'm talking about. If a pupil is in a PRU, you are telling me that they have the curriculum. But for those who are in homes, or in private provision, perhaps who are not in your experience\u2014. Maybe, this morning, we're getting a picture of the best practice, and we're not going under the surface to where things aren't as good in some areas. Do you agree that there is that inconsistency? What we're hearing about now are the best elements. Nick Williams: Consistency is developing across Wales. Sian Gwenllian AM: With the curriculum? Nick Williams: Yes, and in terms of collaboration. I'm not saying that it's perfect, but it is developing. Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you, Si\u00e2n. Questions now from Dawn Bowden. Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. It's really around support. It follows on a little bit from what Si\u00e2n was saying. Can I also just refer back to the point that David was making earlier on about ALN and the extent to which ALN support is available to learners in EOTAS? The information that we've had is that it's difficult enough in mainstream schools, but in an EOTAS setting, it's particularly challenging. So, how can that be improved? What can we do to address that? The reason I'm saying that is there are particular needs of learners in an EOTAS setting\u2014that's why they're there, quite often. So, it's almost more important that that ALN provision follows them through."}

So, it's almost more important that that ALN provision follows them through. David Hopkins: If a child has additional needs, of course they should be met, whatever the setting. But I take your point. There's a possibility that\u2014. Again, going back to the previous question, we would know within, say a PRU or any local authority commissioned or delivered tuition\u2014whatever form that took\u2014then those needs definitely should be being met. I can't tell you hand on heart whether they all are or not\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014but they should be. Once you get out of that very tightly regulated part of the system, then, again, if a child has a particular need, of course that need should be met, but it becomes increasingly difficult. So, I think there possibly is an issue there, but I don't know whether my colleagues have a greater understanding of that. But there certainly may well be an issue there. Dawn Bowden AM: There is a disconnect between what should be happening and what actually is happening, isn't there? Even in some local authority PRUs where we expect all of this to be happening, we know that it\u2019s not; we know that the full curriculum is not being provided either. The basic numeracy, literacy and well-being stuff is taking place, but there is discrepancy of provision, even in local authority commissioned EOTAS provision. David Hopkins: I think there will be variations in provision, but I would say that, within the local authority maintained sector, that provision should be being made. If it's not, the local authority concerned should be aware of that and should be dealing with that. Nick Williams: We've probably\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014in Swansea if you look at the inspections of the provision. Going back some years, they weren't\u2014 What you're describing, it was true. However, the most recent inspection is very positive, and not that we recognise that there's no work to be done; we're not being complacent. But to answer your question, I think the biggest challenge is the capacity. So, I suppose that comes down to additional funding, because I'd like a dedicated educational psychologist spending their time possibly only with our PRU youngsters and EOTAS provision, but we haven't got the capacity because of the demands on us from the wider system. Dawn Bowden AM: And\u2014. Sorry, go on. Sharon Davies: It's kind of what Nick said about capacity, but it's also ensuring the right staff as well, because sometimes, you may have them, but if they move on, or retire, or whatever, there's not a bus load, if you like, of people with that expertise. Because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise, and therefore, it's quite niche, and once that person has moved on, it's really difficult to start all over again. Dawn Bowden AM: I understand that. Sharon Davies: Absolutely. It's more than just one person\u2014it's the whole training package that goes around that capacity as well. Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, and I'll come back to that in a moment. Nick Williams: But I think that's something we could do better. I think we need to be more\u2014. Because that's not just down to money, it's making sure that we perhaps offer, through our teacher training colleges, the opportunity for them to spend some time. At the moment, a newly qualified teacher can't work in this type of provision, which you can argue, that's fine, they need to perhaps get mainstream first. But we need a group of people in the future to fill those gaps. So, that should be built in to their teacher training, and even through their ongoing professional development, both ways\u2014staff actually coming out to schools, going into our provision and vise versa\u2014because you can also get very isolated if you've worked in PRUs for\u2014. You've got very specialist skills, but you perhaps need those wider experiences as well. So, we could be doing more there, and I think that's probably, the group I chair, a discussion we need to have. Dawn Bowden AM: And on that point, actually, we did hear from Estyn the point you were making about the staff leaving and there are very small numbers of staff working in that provision. There really isn't the capacity for them to access professional training. Is that your experience? And if so, what can we do about that? Sharon Davies: I think it's limited. I think it is getting better, as Nick mentioned. There are networks now, there are conferences. It is an improving picture, but I think it's limited. Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, okay. So, is there any way that local authorities can encourage specialist teachers and educational psychologists to actually share expertise with independent providers of EOTAS? Nick Williams: Yes, but again, it's a capacity issue, because if we take them out of the provision, it's difficult for perhaps a supply teacher to come in and manage that class because of the demands. So, it's not an easy conundrum."}

I understand that. Sharon Davies: Or whether there's an opportunity, if somebody wants to lead into that more, that there's an opportunity to do it; that there's an offer there, if they want to specialise more into that area. But at the minute, there isn't that option. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Can I just take you back to pupil support? We talked about ALN. What about access to mental health services? What's your experience of EOTAS learners' access to mental health support? Nick Williams: Again, even in the region there's variation there because we've got three health boards over the footprint of the south-west and mid Wales region. So, it varies. That's my understanding, anyway, and I think that's similar across Wales. Ours hasn't been great, to be honest with you. And that's one of the positive steps, that health boards have to have a DECLO\u00a0now\u2014don't ask me, I can't remember what the exact abbreviation is\u2014but we've met with the designated education clinical lead officer, and I think those partnerships will be strong in the future. But it's also us then having a well-being strategy and support that is universal. So, there's counselling and so on to make sure that the learners are going through, if you like\u2014. Not that we're trying to stop them going through, but we're trying to deal with them appropriately at the different stages so that they're not inundated either. Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, of course. But is your experience also that a lack of mental health support in mainstream schools could potentially be leading to more learners ending up in an EOTAS provision. David Hopkins: I was going to say, about the question, I think there's a general deficit in child and adolescent mental health services, for example. I'm not criticising the services, I'm just saying the capacity isn't there, as we would like. So, I think there's probably a more general issue there that would, in turn, translate into pupils who've got additional needs, whether they're in EOTAS, PRU or wherever. I suspect\u2014I've not got an evidence base to offer you, but there's a very long-standing problem there. Lynne Neagle AM: Si\u00e2n, you had a supplementary. Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. Just to return to teacher training, and you say that new teachers can't go straight into a unit, and maybe more emphasis is needed on that aspect. But generally speaking, if there's an increase in challenging behaviour, are new teachers able\u2014? They don't have the experience, but are they equipped well enough to deal with that? Because we hear of so many people leaving the profession because of this challenging behaviour, and again, I wonder if the system has adequately caught up with that. And we need\u2014not just in this aspect\u2014but we need to look at the system holistically to be more prepared to deal with challenging behaviour. Do you know what I'm saying? Nick Williams: It's not just\u2014. If people decide not to go into teaching after having training, it's not just because of challenging behaviour. There is a change now. There is more time for students in schools, so that helps. You need the theory, but also the practice\u2014that's important to have somebody who can mentor you in the school and that shows good practice. Then there are the policies that the school uses to assure that there is consistency across the whole school. Sian Gwenllian AM: But if we're facing a situation where there are fewer wanting to go into the profession and we are losing those most experienced people, then it creates a great big challenge, doesn't it? We're looking at something very limited here, but we need to look at it in the bigger picture of what's happening. Would you agree with that? Sharon Davies: Yes, certainly. Lynne Neagle AM: Sharon, the CAMHS in-reach project is operational in Gwent,\u00a0but my understanding is that they don't include PRUs. Is that right? Sharon Davies: I don't know if that is the\u2014. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, that's fine, that's my understanding. I just wanted to ask, then, the Gwent attachment team has been working with PRUs in Gwent, and the committee is familiar with the work of the Gwent attachment team, can you just tell us what you think the impact of that has been in terms of support for staff and embedding that awareness of attachment and early trauma in the PRUs? Sharon Davies: I think any form of professional learning, it's positive, and, therefore, as we alluded to earlier, it's that expertise training for the PRU then and for the staff there. It's having a positive impact. At the minute, I don't know what the overall impact is. I think it's early days, but it seems to be positive."}

Nick Williams: Certainly, in our region, in Powys, from north Powys, when you're almost in Oswestry, down to Ystradgynlais, which is not far from me. So, you've got provision for those types of learners there. I think they've got provision in the north and south of the county, but you're still talking\u2014 Janet Finch-Saunders AM: What provision in the north? Nick Williams: I think there's a PRU\u00a0provision in the north of Powys and one in the south\u2014 Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Oh, sorry, north of Powys. Nick Williams: North Powys. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Oh, sorry, I thought you meant north Wales. Sorry. Nick Williams: Sorry. But even so, the distances that those learners are having to travel are huge. Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, I've got a\u2014. It's a big issue. Nick Williams: For myself, and I'd hazard a guess, Torfaen, we're relatively compact, aren't\u00a0we, so it's not such an issue. Lynne Neagle AM: Has the WLGA got any comment on the transport issue? David Hopkins: I'm not aware of issues, if I'm honest, but then again, it may be something we've not investigated. I'm quite happy to look at that. Dr Ian Johnson: I think it's a very difficult subject, because, in many cases, we're not really sure what the data looks like. We get these things from quite a broad perspective, and we don't actually see the extent of the reasons why. If you look at, for example, the statistical release, then you get a sense of why people are being excluded, but they tend to be\u2014. It's a very reductionist discussion, so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour, verbal abuse or physical assaults, but you don't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that. Now, we know that that information exists, because, obviously, schools don't exclude anybody lightly, and I speak as someone who's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools.

David Hopkins: I'm not aware of issues, if I'm honest, but then again, it may be something we've not investigated. I'm quite happy to look at that. Dr Ian Johnson: I think it's a very difficult subject, because, in many cases, we're not really sure what the data looks like. We get these things from quite a broad perspective, and we don't actually see the extent of the reasons why. If you look at, for example, the statistical release, then you get a sense of why people are being excluded, but they tend to be\u2014. It's a very reductionist discussion, so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour, verbal abuse or physical assaults, but you don't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that. Now, we know that that information exists, because, obviously, schools don't exclude anybody lightly, and I speak as someone who's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools. So, there's a great deal of paper trail, but that doesn't seem to really find its way up to a higher level. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And how concerned are you about the trend that we're seeing of an increase in younger children being excluded, and what do you think the reasons might be for that? Dr Ian Johnson: I think it's very concerning that we're seeing increases amongst younger children in particular. Those have gone up quite substantially in the past few years, and a lot of the evidence that we're hearing is quite anecdotal, so it tends to be around the behavioural issues or underlying issues, and there's a lot of discussion about the adverse childhood experiences agenda and how that's\u2014. So, there's a better understanding of that, but I'm not in a position at the moment, really, to be able to explain why primary schools maybe are actually taking that position and excluding more than they used to. Sarah Stone: What I would say is that the reason that Samaritans did our report on exclusions from school rested with\u2014. They began with anecdotal information coming through to us around individual distress and from projects working with young people who'd been excluded. And there are projects that are working with young people who are being excluded\u2014I mean primary school children. And the major thing we say in our report is that we\u2014. So, this is enough to ask us some serious questions, to which we don't know the answer, unless we actually do some serious work on this. So, I would reiterate what we say in our report: that we need to examine this. It's a really important issue, and the life trajectory of those young people is being impacted by their exclusion. Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. You may not be able to answer this, but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions? Dr Ian Johnson: Well, I think it's very interesting, looking at Estyn's pupil registration practices report from October last year, which looks at off-rolling, and I think that you see, specifically at year 10 to 11, a strong impact: around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11, but you're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9, year 9/year 10. So, I think it's clear that there's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11, but what I think is concerning for me is the normalisation, throughout the system, at secondary school level, where there's off-rolling between year 7/8, year 8/9. Based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort, then you're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year, and I think we need to understand why that is the norm, what could be done around that, as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11. The Estyn work is quite factual. It's looking at the numbers. I think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there's a specific reason why schools are doing that, related to the accountability measures. It'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera, but I think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that's currently available. Dr Ian Johnson: The research that we're going to do is really where we're at, and that's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general. I think, in particular, we're aware of increases\u2014quite substantial increases in some cases\u2014regarding self-harm, and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys. Specifically, I think there's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range, but we're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools. My experience of projects that I've been involved in\u2014I was previously in front of this committee as part of the Time to Change Wales project\u2014was that, overall, it depends quite strongly on the senior management team and their commitment. Where the SMT has taken a lead, then it feels that schools are really doing something. Where the SMT are, perhaps, a bit more laissez-faire regarding this, then it feels that maybe schools are not making such a step forward. And to come back to the point, that's why we feel that whole-school approach guidance needs to be statutory, because we'll otherwise reach some quite uneven outcomes, because those who are doing it well will really push ahead and those that are not so engaged will not be helping their pupils in the way that they should be. Dawn Bowden AM: I guess the EOTAS or PRU provision is going to be much more challenging then, isn't it, then main school provision. I suppose that was what I was trying to get at as well, whether you get a sense that there may be some progress being made in mainstream schools, is that following through in PRUs and EOTAS provision? Dr Ian Johnson: I'll just be honest: right now, I couldn't give you an answer on that. I think that is something that, perhaps, slightly concerns me about the whole field is not being able to get a national feel for these issues. I would suspect that there are pockets of very good practice. I've heard discussions about things being done regionally and nationally, but I think it would be good to be able to see what that best practice looks like and how well it's done. Dawn Bowden AM: I appreciate you're not educationalists and you wouldn't necessarily have all of that information, but have you got any sense of\u2014again, whether this is anecdotal or from cases that are referred to you\u2014evidence of schools off-rolling pupils with mental health problems? If you've got any evidence of that, what might the impact of that be on the individuals? Liz Williams: Yes, I think that certainly does happen. I suppose we know this anecdotally from Samaritans research, but also I have experience of working in pupil referral units and working with some really vulnerable children, and I think there is a sense sometimes that these children are labelled as naughty and disruptive. So, children who have additional learning needs or a communication problem that potentially is undiagnosed or not really properly understood. I think when children have mental health problems and additional learning needs, often they can find the school environment really difficult. I've worked with children who have told me that they just don't enjoy being in the classroom because they feel incredibly anxious. They don't feel they can contribute to the school environment, they don't feel like they're keeping up with their classmates and, as a result, they demonstrate challenging behaviour so that they can leave the classroom. I think that's very sad. As a result, these children aren't always understood and are off-rolled in some cases. But, like Sarah said earlier, there are certainly examples of really good practice, and I suppose this links in to what approaches schools, pupil referral units and EOTAS should take to vulnerable children with mental health problems. One example I can give you is that, at one pupil referral unit, the children would get really distressed and really disruptive towards the end of the day on a Friday. I suppose that, in some schools, the teachers would have thought, 'This is ridiculous, they're disrupting the lessons', but what the teachers knew is that these children would go home, they would face such adversity, wouldn't always get a meal, would be exposed to things they shouldn't be exposed to, and the teachers were able to respond to that with compassion and empathy. But, obviously, seeing behind behaviour is really, really difficult, and I don't think teachers should have to do this alone, they should be properly trained and properly equipped. Even going up to a child\u2014and I suppose this goes back to mental health support. Ideally, as Samaritans, we would want suicide prevention plans to be embedded in schools and to be part of the culture of schools, but obviously this can't happen if teachers aren't properly equipped and don't have the confidence to go up to a student and ask them if they're struggling. In our compassion in education toolkit, we highlight the importance of asking a child, 'Are you self-harming?', if there are signs; 'Have you tried to take your own life?', if there are signs. But obviously that's a very difficult conversation to have. So, yes, there are certainly examples of best practice, but I do believe that, if school staff aren't properly equipped and trained, off-rolling pupils, especially at key stage 4, where obviously you will hold those grades, is definitely something that they don't necessarily have the incentive to prevent. So it's worth looking at that. Dawn Bowden AM: You touched, in the beginning of that response, on children being labelled as naughty. To what extent have you come across that? Is that quite prevalent? Is that quite common? Liz Williams: Absolutely, yes. I think it's really down to the school. I think it's down to experience and it's down to the teacher. I think it links up with the question we were asked before about diagnosis and support. Lots of children with communication difficulties especially, if they haven't been formally diagnosed, they are certainly the ones that are deemed naughty, because I suppose people think, 'Well, you should be doing well, you're bright. You should be thriving in school.' But that's not always the case. Children can be incredibly anxious, have mental health problems, obviously, are exposed to ACEs and things that go on at home that not necessarily every teacher would know about. So, I think there are definitely children who are labelled 'naughty', and I think children also play up to that as well. Like I said, if children are very anxious in the school environment and in the classroom, if they know they can get out of the classroom and get into a safe space, they will do that. Dawn Bowden AM: And then that labelling of a 'naughty' child is actually the impediment to getting that child the support that they need. Liz Williams: Absolutely, yes, and I think that's where formal diagnosis can be helpful. I think the doors are open then to much more school support. So, yes, I think it is down to how the school approach it, and it goes back to the whole-school approach and having emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum. It embeds emotional well-being into the culture of the school, and it means that students might know when they need help, how to be more resilient and helping themselves, and when and how to ask for help from the teachers. So, I think it's really important. Dr Ian Johnson: If I can just pick up on one of those points, Mind Cymru conducted a series of focus groups around Wales to inform our response to the new curriculum. One of the comments that I think struck home most strongly with me was a young boy saying that, because the same teacher was responsible for pastoral and behaviour, because he had been labelled as naughty or a troublemaker, he felt uncomfortable in terms of going to that same person within the school in order to disclose the problems he was having, because there was a fear of not being believed or accepted, or it being considered as an excuse for poor behaviour, rather than them being taken seriously. I wouldn't want to over-egg that point, but I think it is an important consideration from a learners' perspective. 'If I disclose a problem, if I want to talk to somebody, are there appropriate considerations within the school setting where I can turn to somebody who maybe I might not have the greatest relationship with in other contexts?' I'd also just like to come back to the off-rolling question if I may, just quite briefly. As I said at the outset of the evidence here, Estyn conducted a piece of work on pupil registration practices that showed a substantially higher amount of off-rolling between year 10 and 11, but also a consistent level\u20141.5 per cent to 2 per cent\u2014in other secondary school years. But we don't have the qualitative material to understand how much of that is related to mental health factors, and how much\u2014because we're in discussion about school accountability\u2014might drive some of that at year 10/11. But we don't know why that baseline of 500/600 young people every year is there within our schools. I think that needs further investigation. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thanks for that. Can I just ask you a couple of other questions about the impact of particular circumstances, and whether you've come across any issues relating to Welsh-medium provision to support the mental health and well-being of learners as an issue\u2014that it's not been available, Welsh-medium support, for those learners? Have you come across that at all?"}

Have you come across that at all? Dr Ian Johnson: We haven't necessarily come across it, but we haven't been looking for it either. The Estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from Welsh-medium education to EOTAS. There are a number of potential reasons for that. That can include the complete lack of EOTAS provision within a local area. It could be the socio-economic profile, because exclusions, et cetera, are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals, and in many parts of Wales the socio-economic profile of a Welsh-medium education school is slightly different. We are not aware of any particular work that's been done to examine the needs and the provision of Welsh-medium EOTAS. Therefore, my suspicion, without any particular evidence, would be that it happens on a local authority basis, possibly on an incidental basis, depending on the quality and the ability of staff, and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west Wales. Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. We can come back to that again, I'm sure. Do you know whether there's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing EOTAS, again in terms of mental health conditions, if there's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision? Have you got any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, of the impact on that? Sarah Stone: Not specifically researched on that situation. I think, again, there is so much that we don't actually know and that we should know a lot more about, but I think there are some things that we can say about delays for young people who are not either in education or in anything else, and they're connected with the issues anyway. So, if you understand that there's a strong link between inequality and exclusion, and that the most likely young people to be excluded have other disadvantages as well, that's a really important issue to understand. So, being out of school or out of education for any time is going to exacerbate those pre-existing inequalities, and I can't emphasis that enough. This is exacerbating this cycle of inequality and disadvantage. So, being outside your peer group makes you vulnerable. It makes you vulnerable, and I guess the longer that continues I would expect the worse that impact and that uncertainty would be. So, there's the impact on loneliness and young people seeking an alternative community to the school one. Since the publication of our report, we have had an extraordinary level of interest from people concerned about crime. So, we've talked to the youth justice board, we've met with the police, there's a huge level of concern about county lines and about home-growing drug gangs, and the fodder that those young people are for people who will engage them in all sorts of activities, which are hugely damaging both to themselves and also to the wider society. So, I think we need to understand there's a lot at stake here for wider society in holding young people, and not allowing gaps to grow where they are not held. I would just refer you to the child death review on suicide and suspected suicide by young people, which came out very recently from Public Health Wales and Swansea University, and that looked at 33 young people who died by suicide over the past few years. One thing that came through that and was reflected in one of their suggestions for action was that those young people had not been held in education or training or employment, had slipped through all sorts of systems, and were extremely vulnerable. So, I think that's a really big message: that we need to try to hold people and not allow those gaps\u2014where they're not held within their society\u2014to lengthen and become really, really difficult. So, I think that's my major message on that particular one. Dawn Bowden AM: Can I just ask, as a follow on from that, whether you've got any views on the potential impact of individual tuition on learners' well-being? So, home tuition, for instance: are pupils going to be on their own doing that? That might be in their best interest, or do you have any concerns that it might not be? Liz Williams: I suppose we don't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils, but what we do know and something that is of huge concern, I suppose, to most people is that there's no central data on how many young people are home schooled. So, it's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally. Also, it is a concern, if children aren't registered with any school, how they get back into school, how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment, if that's what people think is best for them. So, I think that is a concern: not having that transparency of data. And just to reiterate Sarah's point, I suppose, home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things, so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education, but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion, like loneliness and isolation. That child still isn't with its own peer group. That is something that came out of the men's research, as Sarah mentioned. These men, who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide, weren't always interacting with children their own age, and that did cause problems in later life. So, I think it's definitely something we don't know enough about, but I think we need to know more about. Dr Ian Johnson: There are two questions within there, regarding the delay in entering provision and the effect of long term individual teaching. I think there are occasions on which individual tuition will be beneficial, because there may be a reason why somebody is uncomfortable and unable to operate within an educational setting. However, it may be that, on a longer term basis, that is not entirely appropriate. But it's very much an individual matter. What concerns me, I think, is the idea of there being a gap between mainstream education and entering any form of EOTAS provision due to capacity or otherwise, because that is a period in time\u2014. We don't know whether there's the causation of or exacerbation of mental health issues amongst those in EOTAS, but it's clear that\u2014well, it seems intuitive that a gap between being in mainstream education and EOTAS is unhelpful, not least their rights to an education, but also the feelings that young people who are probably in quite a confused and troubled state may have during that gap and how long that gap can endure. I will refer back: there was a recommendation by Estyn in their 2016 report on EOTAS regarding CAMHS support for children within those settings, I don't know whether there's been any particular progress within that\u2014and especially the mixture of issues that may be related to both mental health and also neurodevelopmental issues and whether those are more or less likely amongst this vulnerable part of the population. Sarah Stone: Just to draw your attention to it, I think there's an acknowledgment that there's a lot we don't know about this. Again, in the loneliness and isolation strategy, there's a commitment to analyse existing education and health data to explore correlations between exclusions or being educated other than at school and mental well-being, including loneliness and isolation. So, I think that's a very welcome commitment to try to expand our understanding in this area, because there may be some pluses as well as minuses, but actually there is so much that we don't know about this. Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We've got some questions now from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. I think some of them have been covered, but\u2014 Sian Gwenllian AM: Just in general, once a young person or a child has been excluded, is there enough support for them, not just on the educational side, but in general? Are we supporting these young people, these most vulnerable young people, once they're in the position of having been excluded? Dr Ian Johnson: I'd say that that's something that's possibly happening locally, but we don't have a national picture. One of the things we have already noted is the time between being excluded and entering some kind of EOTAS provision. So, that in itself\u2014and I've heard people talking about the capacity issues\u2014shows what's happening to these children, at a time when they are most vulnerable because they are outside of the system. Sian Gwenllian AM: And who should be supporting them? Are we being clear enough with regard to who should be giving them the support? They've been excluded, so obviously the education system has a responsibility, but are we clear enough in terms of who else's responsibility this is, and who should be co-ordinating that support? Dr Ian Johnson: The truth is, the responsibility lies on the local education authority in that context, I would say. The point is that, often, these children deal with several other institutions. So, it's incredibly important that any service is interweaved into that setting around the child or the children who are in this situation. More information is needed about this. When I was talking earlier about inclusive education, or some kind of investigation into this, that's the kind of thing I'd look at: how to bridge that gap and what kind of support will be available. I'm concerned, of course, in terms of education, whether there is enough funding available to ensure this. But because this is a very vulnerable group, we need to take responsibility in exactly the same way, perhaps, as corporate parenting plays a role there. We need to look at that kind of system, and how we help these individuals. I know there are figures available on local authorities, but I can't remember them off the top of my head, but maybe that's something to look at. Liz Williams: And as Ian just said, although there's a lot of responsibility by the school and the local authority, I suppose some responsibility also sits with the parent as well. But for the parents to support their child, either if they're at risk of being excluded or if the child is already in EOTAS, and that parent wants to make sure that the child is having the best education possible, the parent has to have the right amount of information. They must know where to go for support themselves, and I think that a parent can't necessarily know the rights of their child to education and what their child is supposed to be having if they're not provided with all of the information. And I'm sure this is dependent on the school or dependent on the local authority, but that's something worth thinking about as well."}

Marketing: Oh , user-friendly . Project Manager: In the market , yeah . User Interface: Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know . Project Manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh User Interface: Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control . Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . Sebastian . Industrial Designer: Okay .  Excuse me . User Interface: Scusi . Industrial Designer: Um  Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . Industrial Designer: Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a TV set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a TV set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here , User Interface: Energies and uh Industrial Designer: but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ? Project Manager: No , it's not visible . Industrial Designer: No ? Well  Um , there's a energy source here .  And um basically there  it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look .  Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that .  It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every TV set is controlled infrared . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w User Interface: The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed . Industrial Designer: yes . In the  and it's a little more  a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . Industrial Designer: Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .  So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . Project Manager: So it's fairly easy . Industrial Designer: There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before , Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Succeed in it also . Industrial Designer: and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . Project Manager: Okay , Industrial Designer: So   Okay , so uh Project Manager: good . Industrial Designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every TV set . So I think that uh should be clear . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . User Interface: And what's the um Industrial Designer: I think our uh users will really uh will really like that . User Interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or Industrial Designer: No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . User Interface: Okay . Industrial Designer: So we can use them . So that's no problem . User Interface: For the same costs , it's can be uh in our Industrial Designer: Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making User Interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh Industrial Designer: We can we can make its I think . Marketing: Well you could only lit uh the buttons  the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . Marketing: Or Industrial Designer: Okay . User Interface: But I think Industrial Designer: Hmm . User Interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , Marketing: Hmm , true . User Interface: and not for Industrial Designer: Yes . Well , it's not one light , it  there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . User Interface: Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think . Industrial Designer: No no no , no . That's right , that's right . Project Manager: Okay ."}

Marketing: Oh , mine is already outdated . Project Manager: Okay well , Project Manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product . Marketing: Since uh Project Manager: So any income is welcome .  Input . Marketing: Okay , make  Well  Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of   of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Could you step a little bit more to the right ?  Yeah , thank you . Marketing: But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea . Marketing: Uh well , skip this . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Well , it's  this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the  about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . Industrial Designer: Mm . Marketing: So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . Project Manager: Okay . Well , that's interesting . Marketing: Or Industrial Designer: Or a find  a finding function , User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah , Industrial Designer: you know . Project Manager: that's definitely interesting . Industrial Designer: That's quite a  yes . Project Manager: It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . User Interface: Sound signal . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay , User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: go on . Industrial Designer: Yes . Marketing: Well , I just said that . And uh  well , this obvious , and he also said it . Project Manager: Okay . So that's what the market tells us . Marketing: Uh that's about it , yes . Project Manager: Yep . Okay . User Interface: The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . Marketing: Uh mo uh zap buttons most . User Interface: So Marketing: Volume , they are  uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So User Interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design  The perfect design for those  only those buttons . And first um Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Yep . Industrial Designer: Well , the technical uh  there  I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . User Interface: Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering ,  the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? Industrial Designer: Well Marketing: Yeah , that's uh   a problem . Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yes .  Th that's a bit of  that's a problem . User Interface: Another device is not a solution . Project Manager: Well Industrial Designer: Usually Project Manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , User Interface: It should be uh uh Project Manager: like um turning on and off the the the lights .

Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly .

Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . Industrial Designer: Yes . User Interface: But does it  uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , Project Manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . User Interface: should we just use a  Um it's already uh  oh , we have a blank . Oh . Industrial Designer: yeah , something like that . Oh User Interface: It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what  which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . Industrial Designer: It's not really a stick , but  Yes . Yes . User Interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down Project Manager: Yeah , it can break down . Industrial Designer: Hmm . User Interface: or uh Industrial Designer: Yes , yes . User Interface: just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: And  Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . Marketing: A younger uh  Huh . Industrial Designer: But you're the marketing man . Marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll  it  uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . User Interface: Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . Project Manager: Uh-huh . User Interface: The programme up and down . Project Manager: Okay , yeah . User Interface: And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . Industrial Designer: Okay , that's good . Project Manager: Okay , but w we still  we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . User Interface: But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's  um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have  has the information to discuss about that , I think . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Sure .   .

Marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll  it  uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . User Interface: Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . Project Manager: Uh-huh . User Interface: The programme up and down . Project Manager: Okay , yeah . User Interface: And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . Industrial Designer: Okay , that's good . Project Manager: Okay , but w we still  we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . User Interface: But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's  um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have  has the information to discuss about that , I think . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Sure .   . Project Manager: Okay , um   Okay , so so um   uh Project Manager: Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh Industrial Designer: Yes , that's important . Project Manager: And and do we want um the ten digits ? User Interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . Industrial Designer: Well , are are you sure ? Marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . Industrial Designer: I'm not so sure . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Well , that's complicated , Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think  but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . User Interface: I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . Industrial Designer: Okay , User Interface: Uh and I think the most Industrial Designer: I can imagine when Project Manager: I agree actually . User Interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , Industrial Designer: I can imagine when you're  when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . Marketing: Well User Interface: but Industrial Designer: But if you're uh a regular TV user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh    you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . Project Manager: But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . Marketing: But User Interface: Yep . The older people only use five of them . Industrial Designer: Well , Marketing: Yeah , Industrial Designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? Marketing: and if if we  And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Project Manager: Often . Industrial Designer: No , you're probably right . Marketing: So User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ? Project Manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the Industrial Designer: The design . User Interface: On the design . Industrial Designer: Okay . Well , y then there should be  should done  be done something specific with it . Marketing: Well Project Manager: You c  you can d make them very fancy Marketing: And Project Manager: by um   I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: So I'm I'm  I do not agree User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . Project Manager: Exactly , exactly . Industrial Designer: Okay . Marketing: And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for Project Manager: Okay , speech . Industrial Designer: Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . Project Manager: To find  yeah . Industrial Designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Uh  If if we would um drop the ten digits Industrial Designer: But maybe when we uh Project Manager: but keep the programme and the volume , Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay , okay . Marketing: Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but Project Manager: Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision . Industrial Designer: Okay . Marketing: Yes . Industrial Designer: Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . User Interface: So Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . Industrial Designer: Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button  uh remote control function . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: So that's that's a big advantage , I think . Project Manager: Okay , g good . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this .

Industrial Designer: You have to do nothing for it . Marketing: M User Interface: Twelve dollar fifty . Project Manager: Because it seems like a very Industrial Designer: Maybe , maybe not . Marketing: And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . Industrial Designer: I'll have to find that out . Yes . So  No , that's very cheap . Marketing: 'Cause when Project Manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? Industrial Designer: It's  Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts . Project Manager: I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well . Industrial Designer: It's  Yes , but they're they're mass production . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: They're very cheap . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: So it will cost us p practically nothing . Project Manager: Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um  I would like to hear um  maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ? Marketing: Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . Project Manager: Okay . Marketing: But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So  I don't think that's a big problem Project Manager: Okay . Okay , so Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh  Profitable . We we  yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . Marketing: Yes . Yeah , profitable . Industrial Designer: Profitable . Project Manager: Okay . Marketing: Yes . Project Manager: O okay .  Um Roo .   Nothing to add . User Interface: I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think . Project Manager: Sebastian ? Industrial Designer: Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um Project Manager: Yeah ? Great . Industrial Designer: so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one  the  those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that  these kinds of things . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . Industrial Designer: Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . Project Manager: Yep . Industrial Designer: Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not  do not implement these buttons .  If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another Project Manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board Industrial Designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that  we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: And this even uh makes it more cheapy . User Interface: But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: The board . User Interface: The circuit board . Industrial Designer: The circuit board . User Interface: The fewer buttons you can use on it . Project Manager: No , it's th Industrial Designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . Project Manager: yeah . User Interface: Yeah , okay . Project Manager: It's the other way around , yeah . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage . Project Manager: It shouldn't be a big issue . User Interface: Well it  then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh  especially for the voice recognition . Industrial Designer: It can be costly . Maybe not ."}

There were five points according to which this should be evaluated. The team would have to fit the battery case in the remote and sell lots of squishy things.", "relevant_text": "Project Manager: 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um   Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of  our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think  looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um  so actually I think  Yeah um f  you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of Industrial Designer: Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your  to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes User Interface: You could change the vegetable , or fruit . Industrial Designer: yeah , I can change the vegetable . Project Manager: Oh is that broccoli ? Industrial Designer: This one's broccoli  . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango . Industrial Designer: The  it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . Industrial Designer: You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but Project Manager: 'S a very bright strawberry . Industrial Designer: So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out . User Interface: It's been a l User Interface: It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: Oh yeah . User Interface: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was  or design yet actually , would be the um thing  the locator . How how  so Industrial Designer: Well the locator is just chip that's inside there . User Interface: Okay so that's just Industrial Designer: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere User Interface: So you have to have a button on your on your  you have to attach the button to the Industrial Designer: Yeah we didn't design that . User Interface: Yeah we have  that that has yes yet to be designed . Industrial Designer: But it would be coordinating with that of course . User Interface: Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . User Interface: You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . User Interface: So . Tada . Project Manager: Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there .  But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed Project Manager: I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um   I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be Industrial Designer: My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . Project Manager: Oh . Okay . Industrial Designer: But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and  d I dunno what that means . Project Manager: Right . Industrial Designer: One side is curved and then the other side is curved . Project Manager: Well  yeah . If we're talking about the area just  oh I d I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . Project Manager: Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ? Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: Um and lots of special colours actually .  Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ? Industrial Designer: No I think that's alright . Project Manager: Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . Project Manager: And if we sold a lot of squishy things . User Interface: Mm . Project Manager: Boo yeah . Okay .  S So  Mm . Did y what did you work on ? The Marketing: Um evaluation criteria . Project Manager: Okay . Do you wanna Marketing: I've got a presentation . Project Manager: Okay . I think that's Marketing: So I need  where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't  okay . Um the method is  we  well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is  everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And  we we have therefore in total um  We have five  we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table . Can you see this here ? Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Marketing: Um so the que the questions I've given you  c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . Marketing: I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told . User Interface: Yeah . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own Marketing: Yeah it's in the um  it's in the project documents . User Interface: Is it meeting three minutes ? No it's not minutes . Marketing: It's called evaluation criteria . User Interface: Okay . Marketing: And it's under evaluation . Project Manager: Huh , the PowerPoint one ? Industrial Designer: Hmm ? User Interface: Okay . Cool . Marketing: Yeah . You've found it all ? Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: So it was um  Yeah true's one . User Interface: True's one and false is seven . Marketing: Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? Project Manager: Um we can do it separately and then discuss it Marketing: Yeah okay . Project Manager: if if that's what people wanna do . User Interface: So it's actually a scale . Project Manager: Wait , one is true and Marketing: Um , Project Manager: so these are the questions we're answering . And one is Marketing: yes it's  if it's fancy you put one , Project Manager: One , right okay ."}

No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get  that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of User Interface: Yeah .

User Interface: So like maybe that's just too big Project Manager: Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , User Interface: because Project Manager: which is a nice kind of User Interface: Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .

Project Manager: Or like even User Interface: Dif Industrial Designer: We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .

Professor E: so Grad C: Yeah . Professor E: yeah , there 's separate channels . Grad F: Alright . Grad A: OK . Grad C: Yeah . Professor E: So when I say Grad F: Just plug one ear . Grad A: You lose . Professor E: OK . Grad F: OK , bye ! That was a great meeting ! Professor E: Right . Grad D: Alright . Grad F: So -  Now , uh , why ? Grad C: Just to save time . Grad F: OK . Grad C: Does matter for them . Grad A: Are we gonna start all our meetings out that way from now on ? Professor E: No . Grad A: Oh . Too bad . I kinda like it . Grad F: Well , could we ? Grad D: It 's strangely satisfying . Grad A: Yeah . It 's a ritual . Grad D: Are we to r Just to make sure I know what 's going on , we 're talking about Robert 's thesis proposal today ? Is that Grad C: We could . Grad D: true ? Grad A: We are ? Grad C: We might . Grad A: OK . Grad D: Is Professor E: Well , you  you had s you said there were two things that you might wanna do . One was rehearse your i i talk Grad D: Oh yes , and that too . Grad C: Not  not rehearse , I mean , I have just not spent any time on it , so I can show you what I 've got , get your input on it , and maybe some suggestions , that would be great . And the same is true for the proposal . I will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains . So , um . I don't know how much of a chance you had to actually read it Grad A: I haven't looked at it Grad C: because Grad A: yet , Grad C: but you could always send me comments per electronic mail Grad A: but I will . Grad C: and they will be incorporated . Grad A: OK . Grad C: Um ,  the  It basically says , well \" this is construal \" , and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules how things are construed , and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model  to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what Grad A: Hmm . Grad C: in our beloved tourism domain . But , with a focus on Grad A: Can I s Sorry . Grad F: I think I need a copy of this , yes . Grad C: Hmm ? Grad D: OK , we can  we can  we can pass  pass my , uh  we can pass my extra copy around . Grad F: I is there an extra copy around ? Grad A: Uh . He sent it . OK . You can keep it . Grad D: Er , actually , my only copy , now that I think about it , Grad F: Alrigh Grad A: OK . Grad C: Um , I don't  I , uh  I don't need it . Grad D: but . I already read half of it , so it 's OK . Grad C: Um , actually this is the  the newest version after your comments , Grad F: OK . Grad C: and Professor E: Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that . Grad C: Yeah . Professor E: Yep . Grad D: Oh , maybe the version I didn't have that I  mine  the w did the one you sent on the email have the Professor E: Yeah . Grad D: That was the most recent one ? Professor E: Uh , yeah , I think so . Grad C: Yep . Grad D: OK . Cuz I read halfway but I didn't see a castle thing . Grad A: I 'm changing this . Just so you know . Grad C: Yeah , Grad A: But , anyway . Grad C: um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d Grad A: Oh . Oh , sorry . OK . Sorry . Grad C: current formalism thing that you presented . Grad A: OK . I will . OK . OK . OK . Grad C: But for this it doesn't matter . But , uh Grad A: We can talk about it later . That 's not even ready , so . Um , OK ! Go on t to , uh , whatever . Grad C: And Grad A: I 'm making changes . \" Don't worry about that . \" OK . Mmm - mmm . Oh ! OK , sorry , go on . Grad C: And any type of comment whether it 's a spelling or a syntax or Grad A: Mm - hmm . Grad C: readability Grad F: There 's only one \" S \" in \" interesting \" . Grad C: Hmm ? Grad F: There 's only one \" S \" in \" interesting \" . On page five . Grad C: Interesting . Grad A: Anyway . And y uh , email any time , but most usefully before Grad D: The twenty - first I 'm assuming . Grad A: The twenty - first ? Grad C: Twenty - ninth . Professor E: No , this is the twenty - first . Grad F: That 's Grad D: What , today 's the twenty - first ? Grad F: Well , better hurry up then ! Grad D: Oh , man ! Grad A: Before the twenty - ninth , Grad C: The twenty - ninth . Grad A: OK . Grad D: OK . Grad C: That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him this idea . Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK . Grad C: OK ? Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here and so of course , I 'm  I 'm gonna start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um , then I 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning  The Cave Forty - Five is a  is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that  that time . And so Grad F: OK . Grad C: they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? Uh , which is probably not , uh , the case in that discotheque example , or in the Bavaria example , you just want to know where it is . And so forth . So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine  nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location . Um ,  and so forth and so forth . That 's sort of motivating it . Then what have we done so far ? We had our little bit of , um , um , SmartKom stuff , that we did , um , everth Grad F: Oh , you 've got the parser done . Sorry . Grad C: That 's the  not the construction parser . That 's the , uh , tablet - based parser , Grad F: OK . Grad A: Easy parser . Grad F: OK . Grad C: and the generation outputter . Grad D: Halfway done ? Yeah . Grad C: That 's done . Grad A: Mmm . Grad C: You have to change those strategies , Grad D: OK . Grad C: right ? That 's , ten words ? Grad D: Yeah . Well , i it , you know . Maybe twelve . Grad C: Twelve ? OK . And , um , and Fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak . That 's all about that . Then I 'm going to talk about the data , you know these things about  uh , actually I have an example , probably . Two s Can you hear that ? Or should I turn the l volume on . Grad F: Mm - hmm . Grad A: I could hear it . Grad D: I I can hear it . Grad F: I heard it . Grad D: They might not hear it in the  well maybe they will . I don't know . Grad C: The \" walk into it \" never really means , w as in walked smack Professor E: But \" run into \" does . Grad C: Yeah , but , y y if you find \" walked smacked into the cafe \" or \" slammed into the wall \" Professor E: Yeah , no , but \" run into \" does . Grad C: Mm - hmm . Professor E: Because you will find \" run into , \" uh , Grad D: Cars run into telephone poles all the time . Professor E: well , or \" into the cafe \" for that m Grad C: Right . Professor E: you know  \" His car ran into the cafe . \" Grad C: Yeah . Or you can run into an old friend , or run . Professor E: Well , you can \" run into \" in that sense too . Grad A: Yeah , \" run into \" might even be more impact sense than , you know , container sense . Professor E: But , uh , Right . Grad F: Depends . Professor E: But  Like , \" run into an old friend \" , it probably needs its own construction . I mean , uh , you know , George would have I 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else Grad A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor E: and maybe it is , but , um , there are idioms and my guess is that 's one of them , but , um  I don't know . Grad A: All contact . I mean , there there 's contact that doesn't  social contact , whatever . I mean . Professor E: Uh . Grad F: Sudden surprising contact , Professor E: Yeah , but it 's  it 's  it 's  it 's  Right . i Yeah , it 's more Grad F: right ? Grad A: Forceful . Grad F: But of course , no , i i I mean it has a life of its own . It 's sort of partially inspired by the spatial Professor E: Well , this is this motivated  but yeah Grad F: Yeah .

Grad C: Well there  actually  the  i what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this , uh , from our domain . So maybe if we w if we can make one up  now , that would be c incredibly helpful . Grad A: So , w where it should illustrate Professor E: OK . Grad A: uh  wh when you say all this , do you mean , like , I don't know , the related work stuff , Grad C: How Grad A: as well as , mappings ? Grad C: w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something Professor E: Right  right  r Grad C: and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then we  we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the  to the domain . Professor E: OK , f let 's  let 's suppose you use \" in \" and \" on \" . I mean , that 's what you started with . Grad C: Mm - hmm . Professor E: So \" in the bus \" and \" on the bus , \" um , that 's actually a little tricky in English because to some extent they 're synonyms . OK . Grad C: I had two hours w with George on this , so it , Professor E: OK , what did he say . Grad A: Did you ? Grad C: um  Um . Grad A: Join the club . Professor E: Right . Oh , h that 's Grad C: \" On the bus \" is a m is a metaphorical metonymy that relates some meta path metaphorically and you 're on  on that path and th w I mean it 's  he  there 's a platform notion , Professor E: Yeah , I  I believe all that , it 's just Grad C: right ? \" he 's on the  standing on the bus waving to me . \" Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: But th the regular as we speak \" J Johno was on the bus to New York , \" Professor E: Yeah . Yeah . Grad C: um , uh , he 's  that 's , uh , what did I call it here , the transportation schema , something , Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight , Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: and you can be , you know , on the wagon . Professor E: Right . So  so that  that may or may not be what you  what you want to do . I mean you could do something much simpler Grad C: Yeah . Professor E: like \" under the bus , \" or something , where Grad C: But it 's  it 's  unfortunately , this is not really something a tourist would ever say . So . Professor E: Well , unless he was repairing it or something , Grad C: Yeah . Professor E: but yeah . Grad C: But um . Professor E: Uh , but OK . Grad C: So in terms of the  this Grad A: I see . Grad C: We had  we had  initially we 'd  started discussing the \" out of film . \" Professor E: Right . Grad C: And there 's a lot of \" out of \" analysis , so , um , Professor E: Right . Grad C: could we capture that with a different construal of Grad A: Yeah , it 's a little  it 's , uh  we 've thought about it before , uh t uh  to use the examples in other papers , and it 's  it 's a little complicated . Cuz you 're like , it 's a state of  there 's resource , Grad F: Out of  out of film , in particular . Grad A: right , and like , what is film , Grad F: Yeah . Grad A: the state  you know . You 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource . Grad F: It 's Grad A: I mean . Grad F: yeah , I mean , Grad A: It 's a little bit Grad F: but  and plus the fact that there 's also s I mean , can you say , like , \" The film ran out \" you know , or , maybe you could say something like \" The film is out \" Grad A: Yeah , is film the trajector ? Grad F: so like the  the film went away from where it should be , namely with you , or something , right ? You know . The  the film  the film is gone , right ? Um , I never really knew what was going on , I mean I  I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that  that \" I 'm out of film \" means that I have left the state of having film or something like that , Grad A: It 's weird . That Grad F: but . Grad A: Or , \" having \" is also , um , associated with location , Professor E: Uh . Grad A: right ? Grad F: Yeah . Yeah . Grad A: so if the film left , you know  state is being near film . Grad C: So running  running out of something is different from being out of somewhere . Professor E: Or being out of something as , uh  as well . So \" running out of it \" definitely has a process aspect to it . Grad A: Mm - hmm . But that 's from run , yeah . Professor E: So , Grad F: Mm - hmm . Professor E: b that 's OK , Grad A: Yeah . Professor E: I mean  b but the difference Grad C: Is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it . Professor E: is Grad A: Yeah . So th Professor E: Right . Grad F: Yeah . You got there . Grad A: That part is fine . Grad F: You got to out of it . Professor E: Yeah . Grad F: Yeah . Professor E: But , uh Grad F: Hmm ! Professor E: Yeah , so  so nob so no one has in  in  of the , uh , professional linguists , Grad A: Uh . Professor E: they haven't  there was this whole thesis on \" out of \" . Grad A: There was ? Who ? Professor E: Well , there  I thought  or there was a paper on it . Grad F: Out . Professor E: Huh ? Grad F: There was one on  on \" out \" or \" out of \" ? Professor E: There was a Well , it may be just \" out \" . Yeah . Grad F: OK . Professor E: I think there was \" over \" but there was also a paper on \" out \" . Grad F: Yeah , Lind - Susan Lindner , Grad A: Oh , yeah , you 're right . Yeah . Professor E: Or something . Grad F: right ? The  the  \" the syrup spread out \" ? Professor E: Yeah , and all that sort of stuff . Grad F: That kind of thing ? Grad A: Yeah . And undoubtably there 's been reams of work about it in cognitive linguistics , Professor E: OK . But anyway . We 're not gonna do that between now and next week . Grad A: but . Yeah . Grad C: Yeah . Professor E: OK . So , um Grad A: It 's not one of the y it 's more straightforward ones  forward ones to defend , so you probably don't want to use it for the purposes Grad C: Mm - hmm . Professor E: Right . Grad A: th these are  you 're addressing like , computational linguists , Professor E: OK . Grad A: right . Or  are you ? Grad C: There 's gonna be four computational linguists , Grad A: OK . But more emphasis on the computational ? Or emphasis on the linguist ? Grad C: computer it 's  More  there 's going to be the  just four computational linguists , by coincidence , but the rest is , whatever , biocomputing people and physicists . Grad A: Oh , OK . Professor E: No no no , but not for your talk . I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes Grad C: Oh , the thesis ! Grad A: Oh , I meant this , Professor E: it 's just for one guy . Grad C: That 's  that 's computa should be very computational , Grad A: you know , like  OK . So I would try to  I would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff . Grad C: and , uh , someth Professor E: Yeah . Grad F: Yeah . Professor E: Right . Grad A: You know , it 's an obvious one Grad F: Totally weird stuff . Grad C: I mean the  the old bakery example might be nice , Grad A: but , uh Grad C: \" Is there a bakery around here \" . So if you c we really just construe it as a Grad F: Yeah . Grad A: Around ? Grad C: No , it 's the bakery itself Grad A: Oh . Grad C: is it a building ? uh , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ? Grad A: Oh , oh yeah . Yeah , we 've thought about that . Right . Right . Grad C: And then Grad A: Nnn . No . What ? \" Bakery \" can't be something you 're gonna eat . Professor E: No , no . The question is d do you wanna  do you wanna construe  do you wanna constr - strue Grad F: Sh Grad D: It 's a speech - act . Professor E: r Exactly . It 's because do you wanna c do you want to view the bakery as a p a place that  that  i for example , if  y Grad A: Yeah . Where you can get baked goods . Professor E: Well th well , that 's one . You want to buy something . But the other is , uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , or , Grad F: Mm - hmm . Professor E: um , pfff you know , you wonder how people here make their living , and  there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery Grad F: Yeah . Professor E: that doesn't mean , \" I want to buy some baked goods . \" Grad A: OK . Professor E: But  um , those are interesting examples but it 's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples . Grad A: So it 's a lot of pragmatics , there , that Grad F: Yeah . Grad C: Mmm . Professor E: There 's all sorts of stuff going on . Grad A: might be beyond what you want to do . Professor E: So let 's  so let 's think about this from the point of view of construal . So let 's first do a  So the metonymy thing is probably the easiest and a and actually the  Though , the one you have isn't quite Grad A: You mean the s You mean \" the steak wants to pay \" ?

Grad C: computer it 's  More  there 's going to be the  just four computational linguists , by coincidence , but the rest is , whatever , biocomputing people and physicists . Grad A: Oh , OK . Professor E: No no no , but not for your talk . I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes Grad C: Oh , the thesis ! Grad A: Oh , I meant this , Professor E: it 's just for one guy .

Grad C: and , uh , someth Professor E: Yeah . Grad F: Yeah . Professor E: Right . Grad A: You know , it 's an obvious one Grad F: Totally weird stuff . Grad C: I mean the  the old bakery example might be nice , Grad A: but , uh Grad C: \" Is there a bakery around here \" . So if you c we really just construe it as a Grad F: Yeah . Grad A: Around ? Grad C: No , it 's the bakery itself Grad A: Oh . Grad C: is it a building ? uh , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ? Grad A: Oh , oh yeah . Yeah , we 've thought about that . Right . Right . Grad C: And then Grad A: Nnn . No . What ? \" Bakery \" can't be something you 're gonna eat . Professor E: No , no . The question is d do you wanna  do you wanna construe  do you wanna constr - strue Grad F: Sh Grad D: It 's a speech - act . Professor E: r Exactly . It 's because do you wanna c do you want to view the bakery as a p a place that  that  i for example , if  y Grad A: Yeah . Where you can get baked goods . Professor E: Well th well , that 's one . You want to buy something . But the other is , uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , or , Grad F: Mm - hmm . Professor E: um , pfff you know , you wonder how people here make their living , and  there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery Grad F: Yeah . Professor E: that doesn't mean , \" I want to buy some baked goods . \" Grad A: OK . Professor E: But  um , those are interesting examples but it 's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples . Grad A: So it 's a lot of pragmatics , there , that Grad F: Yeah . Grad C: Mmm . Professor E: There 's all sorts of stuff going on . Grad A: might be beyond what you want to do . Professor E: So let 's  so let 's think about this from the point of view of construal . So let 's first do a  So the metonymy thing is probably the easiest and a and actually the  Though , the one you have isn't quite Grad A: You mean the s You mean \" the steak wants to pay \" ?

Grad C: No . Grad A: How much does it cost ? Professor E: Just beyond that . Grad F: Onward . Grad C: Where is the castle ? Professor E: Yeah . Grad F: A castle . Grad C: How old is it ? How much does it cost ? Grad D: Oh . Grad F: Mm - hmm . Grad A: To go in , that 's like Grad F: Two hundred million dollars . Professor E: Right . It 's not for sale . Uh . So Grad F: Yeah , I think that 's a good example , actually . Grad C: S Grad A: Yeah , that 's good . u Grad C: But as Nancy just su suggested it 's probably ellipticus . Grad A: Ellipsis . Grad C: Huh . Grad A: Like , \" it \" doesn't refer to \" thing , \" it refers to acti you know , j thing standing for activ most relevant activity for a tourist  you could think of it that way , but . Professor E: Yeah . Grad F: Well , shoot , isn't that  I mean , that 's what Grad C: Well , I mean , my argument here is  it 's  it 's  it 's the same thing as \" Plato 's on the top shelf , \" Grad F: figuring that out is what this is about . Grad A: Yeah , yeah , no , I I agree . Grad C: I 'm con you know , th that you can refer to a book of Plato by using \" Plato , \" Grad A: Yeah . No no , I  I 'm agreeing that this is a good , um Grad C: and you can refer back to it , and so you can  Castles have  as tourist sites , have admission fees , so you can say \" Where is the castle , how much does it cost ? \" Um . \" How far is it from here ? \" Grad F: Mm - hmm . Grad C: So , You 're also not referring to the width of the object , or so , Grad A: Hmm . Mm - hmm . Grad C: www . Grad F: Mmm . Professor E: OK . Can we think of a nice metaphorical use of \" where \" in the tourist 's domain ? Um . Grad F: Hmm . Professor E: So you know it 's  you  you can sometimes use \" where \" f for \" when \" Grad F: O Professor E: in the sense of , you know , um , where  wh where  where was , um , \" where was Heidelberg , um , in the Thirty Years ' War ? \" Or something . Grad C: Mm - hmm . Grad F: Uh , yeah . Professor E: You know , or some such thing . Um . Grad F: Like what side were they on , Grad A: What ? Professor E: Yeah . Essentially , yeah . Grad F: or  ? Grad A: OK . I was like , \" Huh ? It was here . \" Like   Um . Professor E: But anyway th so there are  there are cases like that . Um , Grad A: Ah ! Or like its developmental state or something like that , you could  I guess you could get that . Professor E: Yeah . Grad A: Um . Professor E: Um . Grad F: I mean , there 's also things like  I mean , s um , I guess I could ask something like \" Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah \" in a sort of  doesn't nece I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location , just give me a phone number Professor E: Yeah . There certainly is that , yeah . Grad F: and I 'll call them or something like that ? Professor E: You know , \" Where could I learn its opening hours , \" or something . Grad F: Yeah . Professor E: But that 's not metaphorical . Grad A: Hmm . Professor E: It 's another Grad F: Yeah . Professor E: So we 're thinking about , um , or we could also think about , uh Grad C: Well , I  I  I Professor E: How about \" I 'm in a hurry \" ? Grad A: State . Professor E: It i But it 's a state  and the  the issue is , is that  it may be just a usage , Grad F: Hmm ? Professor E: you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical , I don't know . Grad F: Mmm . Grad A: Right . So you want a more exotic one  version of that . Grad F: Oh . Professor E: Yeah . Yeah , right . Grad A: I 'm really into Professor E: Ah ! How about I  I  I  you know , \" I 'm in  I 'm in a state of exhaustion \" ? Grad A: Do you really say that ? Professor E: or something like that , which a tourist w Huh ? Grad A: Would you really say that ? Professor E: A st uh , well , you can certainly say , um , you know , \" I 'm in overload . \" Tu - stur tourists will often say that . Grad F: Yeah . Grad D: I I 'm really into art . Grad A: Yeah , I was gonna say , like Grad D: Uh Professor E: Oh , you can do that ? Really ? Of course that 's  that  that 's definitely a , uh Grad F: Fixed . Grad A: A fixed expression , yeah . Professor E: that 's a , uh  Right . But . Grad A: There 're too  there 're all sorts of fixed expressions I don't  like uh \" I 'm out of sorts now ! \" Professor E: Right . Grad A: Like  \" I 'm in trouble ! \" Grad C: Well I  when , uh  just f u the data that I 've looked at so far that rec Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: I mean , there 's tons of cases for polysemy . Professor E: Right . Grad A: Uh - huh . Grad C: So , you know , mak re making reference to buildings as institutions , as containers , as build Professor E: Right . Grad C: you know , whatever . Um , so ib in mus for example , in museums , you know , as a building or as something where pictures hang versus , you know , ev something that puts on exhibits , so forth . Professor E: Right . As an institution , Grad C: But Professor E: yeah . Grad C: Um . Grad A: Why don't you want to use any of those ? Grad C: Hmm ? Grad A: So y you don't wanna use one that 's Grad C: Yeah , well  No , but this  that 's what I have , you know , started doing . Professor E: The castle  the  that old castle one is sort of Grad C: Metonymy , polysemy . Grad D: I love Van Gogh . Professor E: Yeah . Grad A: \" I wanna go see the Van Gogh . \" Professor E: Ah ! Grad F: Oh geez . Grad A: Anyway , I 'm sorry . Grad C: But I think the argument should be  uh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , because people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical , Professor E: Yeah . Grad C: construal still is , uh , you know , completely , um , key in terms of finding out any of these things , so , um . Professor E: Right . So that 's  that 's  that 's a  that 's a reasonable point , that it  in this domain you 're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy . Grad C: We , uh  I  with a  I looked  with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy . Professor E: And polysemy , and stuff like that . Yeah . Grad C: Hardly anything . So not even in descriptions w did we find anything , um , relevant . Grad F: I have to go . Professor E: Alright . Yeah . Grad C: But OK this is just something we 'll  we 'll see , um , Professor E: Right . s See you . Grad C: and deal with . Professor E: OK , well . I guess if anybody has additional suggestions , Grad C: I mean maybe the \" where is something \" question as a whole , you know , can be construed as , u i locational versus instructional request . Professor E: w Yeah . Grad C: So , if we 're not talk about the lexic Grad A: Location versus what ? Grad C: instruction . Grad A: Instruction . Oh , directions ? Yeah . Professor E: Sure . Grad A: Oh , I thought that was  definitely treated as an example of construal . Grad C: Yeah . Grad A: Right ? Grad C: Yeah but then you 're not on the lexical level , that 's sort of one level higher . Grad A: Oh , you want a lexical example . Grad C: But I don't need it . Professor E: Well , you might want both . Grad C: Mm - hmm . Grad A: Yeah . Grad C: Also it would be nice to get  ultimately to get a nice mental space example , Professor E: We Grad C: so , even temporal references are  just in the spatial domain are rare . Professor E: But it 's  it 's easy to make up plausible ones . Grad C: When  when you 're getting information on objects . Professor E: You know . Grad C: So , I mean Professor E: Right , you know  you know , where r Yeah . What color was this in  in in the nain nineteenth century . Grad C: Yeah . Professor E: What was this p instead of  wh what  you know  how was this painted , what color was this painted , um , was this alleyway open . Grad C: Yeah , maybe we can include that also in our second , uh , data run . Professor E: Uh . Grad C: We c we can show people pictures of objects and then have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth . Professor E: Mm - hmm . OK . So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically . Wish you a good trip . All success . Grad D: For some reason when you said \" feedback electronically \" I thought of that  you ever see the Simpsons where they 're  like the family 's got the buzzers and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying ? Grad A: Yeah . That 's the  first one , I think . The very very first one ."}

User Interface: and you do s your gesture . Project Manager: but you can lose it . User Interface: No no it's n y   if you lose it Industrial Designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the TV to switch to channel one . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay you  so you can build a kind of black box Industrial Designer: Devic Project Manager: and put it on TV and just to recognize gestures and voice .

No , User Interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that Marketing: I mean Industrial Designer: It's not really the  we Marketing: Y Industrial Designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so  or something like that .

Project Manager: Yeah , but uh we want so User Interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .

Marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: so will  it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and  in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like LCD where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , Project Manager: Mm-hmm . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Okay . Industrial Designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation User Interface: Uh-huh . Industrial Designer: or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come User Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: and  so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . Project Manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm . Project Manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers Industrial Designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Marketing: Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , Project Manager: no ? Industrial Designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will  if we want to have battery , regular battery and and  the solar energy battery it could be  it'll it will add a little bit of the price , Project Manager: So . Industrial Designer: but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: so hmm . Project Manager: And what tha what about the uh materials ? Industrial Designer: And the materials , it depends for example you  if you have a wooden material it can be more  the plastic material is more common Project Manager: Impersonal , mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , Project Manager: Yeah .

Industrial Designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . Project Manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and  so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Project Manager: And you think that we will be Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: so . Project Manager: So wood . Project Manager: And what about the buttons ? Industrial Designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the LCD you know  lighted buttons because , you know , it's  I don't know  um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion Project Manager: No it's fashion , yeah . Industrial Designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch TV in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . Marketing: What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess . Industrial Designer: I think a touch screen  will be t as expensive as the LCD buttons so . Marketing: Mm . Industrial Designer: But  And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of Marketing: Yeah . User Interface: So you got email ? Project Manager: I dunno .  I think we have only   uh five minutes left . Marketing: Okay . Project Manager: Participant four ? Functional requirements ? Marketing: Uh no , trend watching .  The other one . Project Manager: This one ? Marketing: Yeah . Uh , I think so , just  Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . Marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  I mean  i i it sounds good technically User Interface: Mm . Industrial Designer: Mm . Marketing: but it's it's not what they want and uh  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Project Manager: Okay . Marketing: At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . Marketing: Now i if we look at fashion in general um  Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , Industrial Designer: Ah yes . Marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah . Marketing: 'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . Industrial Designer: Okay . Marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris Industrial Designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . Marketing: we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , Industrial Designer: Spongy  'Kay . Marketing: okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah , yeah . Marketing: I dunno .

Project Manager: but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . Industrial Designer: But it will be embedded on the TV and not on the remote control , so . Project Manager: That's true . Marketing: Yeah  d User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , Marketing: I dunno . User Interface: Mm . Project Manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . User Interface: Yeah . It's good . Project Manager: And LCD buttons . Industrial Designer: Yeah , LCD . Project Manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to Marketing: What interface ? Project Manager: Yeah , for the interface something  added value . Industrial Designer: I think the supplement can be the voice  . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of Project Manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Project Manager: commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Mm . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . Project Manager: Turning the TV o on o or off . Industrial Designer: Yeah , turning   yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands , Project Manager: So , Industrial Designer: so . Project Manager: adding some vocal commands . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Simple ones ? Industrial Designer: Yeah , simple ones for Project Manager: Okay .  So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes  so  we'll  you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . User Interface: Yeah . User Interface: Yep . Yeah . Project Manager: Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons"}

People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um  It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text TV still has to be a possibility . And it has to be easy to learn . That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text TV button . That are the functions . That right ? Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Yes . Project Manager: So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your Marketing: Shall I start ? Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: No . Okay well  I received an email  Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following .  The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh  This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh LCD or uh speech recognition . User Interface: Hmm . Marketing: But um  this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative . Project Manager: But we already have the flashing flashing light on the Marketing: Uh maybe maybe something new . User Interface: Yeah , more . Industrial Designer: Hmm . Marketing: We have to discuss about it s uh  Okay , uh Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Well , I'll I'll get back on it . Marketing: features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari  uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes . Project Manager: Hmm . Marketing: But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . User Interface: Spongy . Marketing: But spongy , what what does spongy says ? Industrial Designer: Spongy . User Interface: Spongy , like sponge . Marketing: Spongy . Okay . Industrial Designer: So rubber , kind of . User Interface: Uh soft materials . Project Manager: But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be  flexible . User Interface: Yeah , but  Yeah . Marketing: Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah . Industrial Designer: It's like a sponge . User Interface: Soft , sponge . Marketing: So it's also a stress-ball . Project Manager: That's a good  That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea . Industrial Designer: Yeah , somewhat like User Interface: Yeah , but  Yeah . Project Manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the  remote control ? User Interface: How are you gonna make it ? Project Manager: R_ soft . Industrial Designer: Yeah , Marketing: Uh Industrial Designer: I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation . Project Manager: Okay . Marketing: Okay ? Marketing: What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot . Marketing: And uh some basic uh colour fronts .  Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .  Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh  Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget . User Interface: Yeah , I'll get back on that . Industrial Designer: Hmm . Marketing: So Project Manager: It's very uh difficult to to to do it . Marketing: Intro Project Manager: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . Marketing: Yeah . User Interface: Well , Marketing: Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem . User Interface: I got f also an email from the the technology department . Marketing: So  Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations . User Interface: They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Well Industrial Designer: Hmm . Marketing: Okay . User Interface: I'll check what they exact mean . Marketing: Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then . User Interface: So uh Industrial Designer: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap User Interface: Yeah , Industrial Designer: and it's easy to implement . User Interface: th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so  Um but uh User Interface: if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement LCD as well . Marketing: Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can User Interface: Since you have to uh configure speech thing . Project Manager: But that's definitely more expensive than User Interface: Yeah , that's that's something I dunno . Marketing: Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be  . Project Manager: Yeah , but a telephone   Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a LCD and and it's about t two hundred Euros . User Interface: Yeah , so uh we gotta de Project Manager: So uh User Interface: We have to decide on that . Marketing: Yeah . Okay . That was this ? User Interface: Mm uh Industrial Designer: Oh I got an email uh  And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And  Um  They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So User Interface: L_D_C_ doesn't require Industrial Designer: it's m the most expensive . Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip . User Interface: Okay . And speech recognition ? Industrial Designer: Yeah , probably too . User Interface: Advanced  . Yeah . Industrial Designer: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but User Interface: I'll I'll give you my design . Industrial Designer: Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display . User Interface: Yeah okay . So we   Well we can  I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um  This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones . Project Manager: Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic . User Interface: More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out  both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so Industrial Designer: Hmm . User Interface: It's the most important part , I think . But  And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons . Project Manager: Yeah , maybe the teletext tel User Interface: Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable , Project Manager: No . User Interface: but it's Marketing: No , I don't uh  I don't like it . User Interface: Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So Industrial Designer: Hmm . User Interface: and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten .  And I think Industrial Designer: But it  That's on on the display . User Interface: No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: So the focus is on these two parts . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: So you don't see all the buttons you else need . Project Manager: But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . User Interface: Uh well um Project Manager: So you can't use your thumb for it . User Interface: This is how it is now . Um  Here uh  Well we have volume . Project Manager: Yeah , Industrial Designer: I think it is on uh on the bottom too . Project Manager: down there . But it's not not the best best . User Interface: Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . Project Manager: Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too . Project Manager: Yeah , why not ."}

Industrial Designer: Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . Project Manager: Yeah , that's better . User Interface: They're on top ? Project Manager: Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text TV . Put that on the button bottom . Industrial Designer: Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons . User Interface: You mean uh these to the low ? Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button . User Interface: Oh okay . Well , yeah . Industrial Designer: But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom . User Interface: Mm  Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll Industrial Designer: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . User Interface: Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to  . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . Industrial Designer: Yeah okay . User Interface: And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh  you don't see 'em very good . Industrial Designer: That's that's good , but User Interface: I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there . Industrial Designer: Yeah okay . User Interface: But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: So we can uh switch these to Industrial Designer: Hmm . User Interface: I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . Industrial Designer: No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . User Interface: Okay . Yeah , maybe Industrial Designer: But uh we we can switch those two , User Interface: Those two , yeah . Industrial Designer: yeah . User Interface: And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh  Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . Marketing: Okay . User Interface: Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we  I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah , that's cool . User Interface: To use Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: No . User Interface: So that's something we have to decide on . Industrial Designer: Yeah , we have to keep it simple . Project Manager: We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look . User Interface: Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay . Industrial Designer: Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not  Nothing square-like . Project Manager: Okay , so  Hmm , okay . User Interface: Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved  square . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Square . Like . Industrial Designer: Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think . User Interface: Okay . So not Industrial Designer: So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing . User Interface: Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look . Industrial Designer: Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of Project Manager: Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the  remote control . Industrial Designer: looking , I think . Marketing: Mm . Industrial Designer: Okay . Project Manager: So the colours also . User Interface: Mm   Yeah , it's Project Manager: So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . User Interface: Black yellow control . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black . Industrial Designer: Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . User Interface: Yeah , but uh  I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But Project Manager: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . Industrial Designer: No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but User Interface: Yeah , okay . Industrial Designer: We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think . User Interface: Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So Project Manager: Yeah , it's cool . Yep . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue Project Manager: And still trans User Interface: Yes . Project Manager: Still still transparent . User Interface: So Industrial Designer: and Marketing: Oh yeah . User Interface: Yeah . But with all with logo on it . Industrial Designer: Okay . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um   Then the components . The case has just a  Here's black . Project Manager: Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ? User Interface: Well one of the options . Industrial Designer: S User Interface: You can  Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . Industrial Designer: Okay . User Interface: So you can just replace them I think . That was the idea , Industrial Designer: Yeah , we could do that . User Interface: or just uh release one . Project Manager: Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box .  Five different User Interface: Yeah , uh  Or just uh sell different ones . Industrial Designer: Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . Project Manager: Yeah . Cool . Industrial Designer: So you can still th look through it . User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer: Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft . User Interface: Yeah , Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: I uh I dunno . Project Manager: It it could be like a Nokia , like  plastic . User Interface: A more  Yeah , just uh Marketing: Uh uh Project Manager: That's better prob Industrial Designer: With the hard hard buttons . Project Manager: Yeah .

User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Okay . User Interface: Or it runs the whole Industrial Designer: Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So Project Manager: They can choose . User Interface: Yeah , you can halfs transparent , Industrial Designer: Or no User Interface: or just that it's comes out a bit . Industrial Designer: Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights User Interface: Different , I think , also . Industrial Designer: or Project Manager: Blue . Industrial Designer: Yeah ? User Interface: Blue or red . User Interface: Whatever you want it , I think . Marketing: Yeah . User Interface: Uh depends on the colour of the Project Manager: Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . Marketing: Uh i Project Manager: You have to choose User Interface: Yeah , that's true . But Industrial Designer: No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So Project Manager: Is it  Okay . Marketing: Yeah , Industrial Designer: I I know  I dunno . Is Marketing: but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? User Interface: Yeah , it can . Project Manager: Yeah , okay . User Interface: 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well . Marketing: You Industrial Designer: Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive . Project Manager: Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just  No , just some LED . User Interface: I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone . Industrial Designer: I think it's User Interface: And I can change the colour of it . Project Manager: Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it  I th I don't think so . User Interface: Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So Marketing: Hmm . Industrial Designer: Then uh some more technical things . Industrial Designer: I don't know what it is , but it should be there  I think . Industrial Designer: Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things . Project Manager: Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so Industrial Designer: W  So we d we just need this and  this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things . Industrial Designer: Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls . User Interface: I'm sure we can fit in . Industrial Designer: So I guess we j we just need that . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: I don't know what they do or User Interface: Yeah okay . Marketing: Okay yeah , User Interface: We just Marketing: you can you can change  Yeah . No . Industrial Designer: Nah , but they just said we need it . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in . Project Manager: Yeah , a recharger maybe . User Interface: Yeah , we have to make sure to uh Industrial Designer: Yeah okay . Project Manager: We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? Industrial Designer: Yeah but Project Manager: Is that still the User Interface: Yes . Yes . Industrial Designer: Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an  How do you call it ? Accu . Project Manager: A recha Oh no . Uh  Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah . User Interface: Re recharger . Base station . Industrial Designer: Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries . User Interface: Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best . Industrial Designer: Okay . Not a separate Project Manager: No , just rechargeable batteries . Industrial Designer: Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one . Industrial Designer: Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh  Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda . Marketing: Ah cool . Okay . Project Manager: But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch . User Interface: So if you hold it , it gets powered . Industrial Designer: If you hold it . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and  Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors , Project Manager: It's dark in the room . No . Project Manager: It's just batteries , Industrial Designer: so Project Manager: that's cheaper  . Industrial Designer: Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth . Marketing: Okay . Industrial Designer: So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . User Interface: Mm . So"}

Um these kinda materials can be used . Project Manager: But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think so too . Project Manager: The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume . Industrial Designer: Yeah , scroll wheels um User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: But I think just the volume is enough .

Project Manager: Yeah , okay . User Interface: Okay . Industrial Designer: And um  Yeah , that was it I guess . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or Project Manager: Oh just sk Industrial Designer: We haven't decided yet . Project Manager: Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's User Interface: Uh I don't think a rubber case looks Industrial Designer: L Marketing: Uh but we have to do something about the trend . Industrial Designer: Yeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ? Marketing: The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . User Interface: Yeah , okay . That  Uh fruit and veg , or Marketing: And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two . User Interface: Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers . Marketing: Uh yeah i Just  Just on front . User Interface: So you can  the the spongy  yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control . Project Manager: No . Marketing: Neith uh I don't like it uh neither . Project Manager: No . User Interface: I just can't imagine it . Industrial Designer: So just hard plastic ? Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Yeah , I think . Industrial Designer: Okay . User Interface: Titanium . It's mentioned here uh . Industrial Designer: Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive . Project Manager: But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit Industrial Designer: Yeah , Project Manager: more rounded . Industrial Designer: you can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth . Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah , that's right . User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: So  We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . So the energy uh is the recharger . Project Manager: We already know that . Just a normal battery . User Interface: Yeah . We have batteries . Project Manager: Okay . The chip-on-print is a normal one . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: Regular . Project Manager: Okay , the case is just a plastic one . Industrial Designer: Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one . Industrial Designer: Like a very big scroll-wheel . Project Manager: Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it . Industrial Designer: Okay . Project Manager: Maybe , I dunno . Industrial Designer: Hmm . Project Manager: Okay , so we  have this at the moment . Industrial Designer: I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted . User Interface: Yeah , you Project Manager: Okay , so User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: we'd have this . Is that okay ? User Interface: Yeah , Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: that's a little problem , of course , as well . Industrial Designer: I think it's probably better . Project Manager: And Industrial Designer: Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger . User Interface: Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh  That's not scrollable too easy . Project Manager: Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? Still on the bottom Industrial Designer: I think in middle . Project Manager: or User Interface: Uh wh what is the middle part ? Project Manager: That's the numbers . User Interface: Numbers , okay . Industrial Designer: Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . User Interface: Yeah , I agree as well . Project Manager: It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . User Interface: Use the dz Project Manager: Because you already have the volume here , so  You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other .  back and forth . User Interface: Yeah , that's right . Project Manager: So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well . Industrial Designer: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . Project Manager: But that's not  want to zap very quick , so User Interface: Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority . Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . Project Manager: Yeah ? Is this a opportunity , User Interface: And then you use those uh Project Manager: or you don't want a different User Interface: Yeah , of course uh . Industrial Designer: Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so Project Manager: Why ? Industrial Designer: Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up Project Manager: But still the next  It's still the next one . Doesn't make Industrial Designer: Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is   If you put them Project Manager: Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference . User Interface: Yeah . I I think it's  It's it's obvious , I think . Industrial Designer: But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing . Marketing: Yeah , that's not not  It's not al uh always the same . Project Manager: But it's exactly th Industrial Designer: In uh  On most on most remote controls . Marketing: Every remote control's uh different . User Interface: Yeah , I think Industrial Designer: So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time . Project Manager: I dunno . I  You already have the volume on the side , User Interface: No , uh I think Project Manager: so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . User Interface: Yeah .

Li Yeah , we had one example . Industrial Designer: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . User Interface: Mm . Mm . Marketing: Yeah , User Interface: Which w Marketing: but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then . User Interface: Here you see one that's very round . Industrial Designer: Oh yeah , okay .

Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah Project Manager: Just round it up  . Industrial Designer: Yeah .

User Interface: I think i User Interface: Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh  As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . Project Manager: Shapes .

Just just more like this and not uh a square . User Interface: Yeah okay , yeah well Marketing: Okay . Industrial Designer: Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . I would do it User Interface: Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but Marketing: Yeah , it Industrial Designer: Like in this kind of shape or Marketing: Uh it's very annoying . Okay . Industrial Designer: I dunno . I dunno if it's handy . User Interface: I think it will only look more like the old remote controls . Marketing: Uh Industrial Designer: This ? User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing . User Interface: Yeah okay . But uh I had a lot of pictures  Oh I can show you here  what the old ones look like . Industrial Designer: Mm . User Interface: Curves , curves . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: You've more  there as well . Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .

User Interface: I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look . Marketing: Yeah . User Interface: So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . User Interface: No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: And you have the scroll button inside .  Okay . User Interface: Yes . Just a simple scrollb Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ?

Just you have a normal Industrial Designer: Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public . Marketing: There is one  There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . It must have uh uh uh a very different User Interface: Yeah ,  idea . But  you're  If you look at the way remote controls are now Project Manager: But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy . User Interface: And if you make it look like the iPod Marketing: Yeah , they're all the same . User Interface: Yeah okay . So that's already a very big change Project Manager: Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the  wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction . User Interface: compared to Industrial Designer: Hmm . User Interface: Ye yeah . Well uh Industrial Designer: Yeah , we could do that . User Interface: Could . Marketing: Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: No , I think  Oh . Project Manager: It's right . User Interface: Think the scroll wheel  won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: So it will just be a small small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much . Project Manager: Yeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has  if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly . So maybe you have to ask her . User Interface: Yeah okay . Well , Marketing: No . User Interface: maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint . Project Manager: Okay . Yeah . That's probably User Interface: I'll be able to do a better job . Marketing: If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here . Doesn't work . Project Manager: Okay , so just finish it . So we make it a bit like m that one probably . Yeah . Is that okay ? Marketing: Yeah , I'll see it . User Interface: Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod  . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the User Interface: Yes . Project Manager: We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . User Interface: Just a  Speech . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think Project Manager: Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a Industrial Designer: S User Interface: Well uh Project Manager: advanced chip . User Interface: then it w Industrial Designer: Uh yeah , I don't know . Yeah , I think so . Marketing: Uh Industrial Designer: And we we have to build in a microphone and User Interface: Well that's very easy . We already have uh the beeping of the  home station , Industrial Designer: Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that .

Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the sixth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 pandemic. Today's meeting is taking place by videoconference. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. When you are ready to speak, please activate your mic. When you are not speaking, leave your mic on mute. Of course, change the language when you change the language on the screen.  I would remind hon. members that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel; if you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel; and should you wish to alternate between the two languages, as I just did, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking, each time you switch languages. In addition, please direct your remarks through the chair and speak slowly and clearly at all times to help our interpreters. Finally, for members who will be speaking, we strongly recommend that you use a headset. I recommend the headset for your fellow members, but also for the interpreters as it gets loud, up and down, and it squeaks. It really does make it difficult for them if you do not have the prescribed headsets. We'll go on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we will proceed to presenting petitions, for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. We will now proceed to presenting petitions. Ms. Heather McPherson (Edmonton Strathcona, NDP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. World Maternal Mental Health Day took place last week, and today I'd like to take a moment to present a very important petition on behalf of the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative. Whereas perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are the most common obstetrical complication, whereas in Canada and worldwide 20% of women and 10% of men suffer from a perinatal mental illness, resulting in an annual economic cost to Canada of approximately $11 billion, and whereas the U.K., Australia and parts of the U.S. have perinatal mental health strategies and screening guidelines in place and Canada does not, the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative is calling upon the House of Commons in Parliament assembled to create a national perinatal mental health strategy that will provide direction, policy and funding to develop specialized, comprehensive perinatal mental health care services, which include universal screening and timely access to treatment for all women and men during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Mr. Scott Reid (LanarkFrontenacKingston, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. My petition relates to cystic fibrosis. If we were in the House now, as May is Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month, one of the days this month we would all be wearing yellow roses in sympathy and solidarity with those who suffer from what is the number one disease killer in Canada of young people. The petitioners have asked us to look at the situation with the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which is scheduled to go through some important and potentially detrimental regulatory changes very soon. They ask that the amendments to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board be rescinded, as these will restrict Canadians from receiving life-saving medications for cystic fibrosis and other illnesses, but in particular, a medicine called Trikafta, which can have the effect of treating cystic fibrosis in the case of 90% of cystic fibrosis sufferers. They ask the government to work with the provinces to find a strategy to jointly allow for the delivery of this life-saving medicine to Canadians across the country and to take a leadership role in negotiating a price for gene modulators throughout all the provinces of Canada. Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's an honour to take the mike today, with all colleagues here. It's good to see you all virtually and safe. Petitioners in my community point out in this petition, which, of course, predates the pandemic, that the family doctor shortage is severe in this country. Nearly five million Canadians lack a regular family doctor. This problem is particularly profound in more rural areas, including, as the petitioners reference, the community in which I live, Sydney, British Columbia. We have a very significant crisis and a lack of family doctors. The petitioners call on the government to work with provinces and territories to find a collaborative, holistic solution so that every Canadian has a family doctor and we address the family doctor shortage. Mr. Brad Vis (MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, CPC): Good morning, Mr. Chair. I'm presenting a timely petition today that emphasizes the concerns constituents in my riding of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon have with the Liberal government's inherently flawed and undemocratic approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed RCMP-vetted Canadians; to focus taxpayer dollars where they will actually increase public safety, which is on keeping at-risk youth from being involved in gangs and on anti-gang enforcement; and to provide our men and women in uniform at the Canada Border Services Agency with the resources they need to stop the flow of illegal guns into this country. Through this petition, my constituents take issue with how the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal weapons smugglers responsible for the violence in our communities. They note that the use of the phrase military-style assault rifle is purely political posturing, as the term is undefined in Canadian law. They also draw attention to the numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation The Chair: I'd like to remind the honourable members that this is a concise prcis of what a petition says, not a speech. I'll let Mr. Vis continue. I'm sure he'll be very brief in wrapping up. Mr. Brad Vis: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. That's sufficient. The Chair: Okay. Now we'll go to Mr. Johns. Mr. Gord Johns (CourtenayAlberni, NDP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's a huge honour to table e-petition 2512, which was signed by 1,198 petitioners, primarily from the province of Nova Scotia. The Province of Nova Scotia invited multinational companies to scope out and develop expansive open-net salmon farming operations. The petitioners cite that the expansion would increase environmental degradation, as seen in similar aquaculture operations in British Columbia, Newfoundland, Norway, Vietnam and elsewhere in the world. It also, they cite, would pose risks to native fish stocks, pollute coastal ecosystems, impair at-risk wild Atlantic salmon, and threaten established fisheries and tourism operations. They also raise concerns that open-net fish farming would not create significant employment and would undermine existing lobster and other fisheries. They are calling on the government to uphold Bill C-68 and species-at-risk legislation, protect our oceans, ban expansion of open-net finfish aquaculture in our oceans, work to phase out any existing open-net fish farming operations currently in place and, lastly, invest in land-based, closed-containment finfish aquaculture. I want to thank these petitioners for fighting for clean oceans, for their local economy and for the well-being of Nova Scotia. Mr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. This petition was signed and sent in by constituents of my riding of NanaimoLadysmith. It calls upon the House of Commons to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on Wet'suwet'en territory, ordering the RCMP to dismantle its exclusion zone and stand down, scheduling nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentssomething that has already happened, thankfullyand prioritizing the real implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Ms. Yasmin Ratansi (Don Valley East, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of Don Valley East. The petitioners are asking that the Government of Canada not provide any financial assistance to Canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to COVID-19. They are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to, within or from Canada. The petitioners feel that these Canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund. The Chair: We'll now proceed to questioning ministers. The first question will go to Mr. Albas. Mr. Dan Albas (Central OkanaganSimilkameenNicola, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Today we've learned that federal workers have been told to ignore obvious signs of fraud when it comes to applying for government benefits. Can the Prime Minister confirm that 200,000 applications have been flagged as potentially fraudulent? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Our priority from the beginning has been to make sure that Canadians get the support they need. We moved very quickly to get the Canada emergency response benefit out, to get the wage subsidy out and to help Canadians in this unprecedented situation. We recognize there will be challenges, and we are going to work through those challenges. Our priority every step of the way was to make sure we helped as many Canadians as possible. Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, can the Prime Minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent? This is important. Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Our focus has been on helping as many people as we possible can. Our decision from the very beginning was to get the help out to people and figure out, with retroactive action if necessary, where and when there may have been fraudulent use. Our priority was getting that help out. Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, this came from a memo issued by a deputy minister. Did the minister's office or the Prime Minister sign off on this memo? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Again, in this unprecedented situation, our focus has been on helping as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. Other parties might have made a different choice had they been in government, but our focus was getting help to people when they needed it as quickly as possible and cleaning it up afterwards. Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, I asked a very simple question. Did the Prime Minister or his minister sign off on this memo that was issued by the deputy minister, yes or no? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we have been focused entirely on getting help to Canadians when they need it, and that has meant that yes, there will be things we will need to clean up after the fact and work to fix, but getting that help into Canadians' pockets during this pandemic was our priority."}

Mr. Dan Albas: I'm asking the Prime Minister to show some accountability. Did he or his office sign off on this memo? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, my office and I have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to Canadians. Perhaps, as Mr. Albas points out, other parties would have been slower to get the money out. We were flowing money to people who needed it. Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, the question was quite simple. Obviously the Prime Minister doesn't seem comfortable with the answer. Will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud, or will he write them off, as the story said? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, in this unprecedented situation Canadians have lost their jobs; they've lost their paycheques; they don't know how they're going to be able to support their loved ones and pay for their groceries. We made a decision as a country that we would be there for them and that has been and will continue to be our priority. Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister can leave the cottage talk for the cottage. We're asking a very simple question here. Will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud, the fraud will be pursued? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: My commitment as Prime Minister and as a government is to support and protect Canadians. That is what we are doing by giving them the support they need through this unprecedented situation. Perhaps other parties don't think it's important to support Canadians. We will keep focused on supporting Canadians. Mr. Dan Albas: That's not what I'm asking here, Mr. Chair. The Conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through. What we are asking about is fraud. All along we've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact, and we expect that to happen. Can the Prime Minister at least confirm that this will happen? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: When we made the determination that we needed to move quickly to help Canadians, we knew there would be a need to clean up after the fact, to go after fraudulent cases. We will do that. Our priority now and in the coming months is to ensure Canadians get the support they need, and our economy comes roaring back. That's what we're focused on. The Chair: We'll now continue with Mr.Ste-Marie. Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie (Joliette, BQ): Mr.Chair, yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the large employer emergency financing facility. That's good. What's even better is that he announced that the loans would be tied to conditions. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent! Unfortunately, I quickly became disillusioned because it is more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Basically, we're talking about fraudsters. There are no conditions that would allow us to tighten the screws on profiteers. Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. Why does the Prime Minister continue to support the profiteers? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. It's a priority of our government. There is no tolerance for tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs. That's why we are introducing measures that support workers, who will continue to be our priority. Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: Mr.Chair, I'm delighted to hear the Prime Minister say that there's no tolerance for tax avoidance. The problem is that his remarks don't reflect reality. Tax avoidance is the legal use of tax havens. The five big Bay Street banks benefit from this, as do the big multinationals. It's time to tighten the screws on these companies. They have to pay their share. Will the Prime Minister and his government outlaw what is immoral? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, when we announced the large employer emergency funding facility, we recognized that those who wanted to receive tax dollars had to have paid their fair share of taxes. That's why we're putting in place measures to carefully assess the tax structures of these businesses before we loan money to them. Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: Mr.Chair, sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in Canada and register them in a subsidiary in the Bahamas, Barbados or another tax haven. Does the Prime Minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in Canada? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will assess applications for the large employer emergency funding facility on a case-by-case basis. We don't expect the big banks to need these funds. Before we provide any money, we're going to make sure that whoever wants to access these funds is transparent about how the money is being managed, including internationally. Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: Mr.Chair, I'll change the subject now. Consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards, which allows contactless payments in shops, not to mention online shopping. This benefits Visa and Mastercard, which charge appallingly high user fees, known as interchange fees. These are almost 10times higher than in Europe and Australia, and it costs our merchants a fortune. Can the Prime Minister follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping interchange fees at0.3%? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are always looking for ways to reduce costs for consumers. We have worked with the big banks and the financial industry to ensure that people who need it have access to the help they need. We're reassessing how we can lower costs for consumers. Right now, we're sending money to consumers across the country who need it to get through this crisis. That's what we'll continue to focus on."}

Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: Mr.Chair, the question doesn't concern consumers, but merchants. A credit card company, such as Visa and Mastercard, that charges a fee of 2.5%to3% per transaction undermines the merchant's profit margin and gets richer at the expense of consumers. I invite the Prime Minister to follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping these fees at0.3%. Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation. Of course, there are some things we can look at over the longer term as well. The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Kwan. Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Instead of providing a universal direct payment for all, the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind. A single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. She pays taxes on her spousal income, but she is not eligible for CERB. The Minister of Employment said that she is looking into this gap. It has been weeks, and still no action. Will the Prime Minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: I'm happy, Mr. Chair, to correct the honourable member by pointing out that we actually moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit. However, as the member points out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and that's why we've been working diligently to try to fill those gaps. We want to make sure that Canadians who need help, get it. Ms. Jenny Kwan: While the Minister of Employment has been aware of this for three weeks and says she is looking into it, there's still been no action. The truth of the matter is that single parents and their children who depend on spousal support and child maintenance are not getting support. Will the Prime Minister fix this gap? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: We recognize the particular challenge faced by families, single parents and families with young children, which is why we increased the amount of the Canada child benefit to be able to support people in this particular moment. On top of that, we have looked to fill further gaps that have existed with the Canada emergency response benefit. Well over seven million Canadians have access to CERB, and we will continue to work with them Ms. Jenny Kwan: That does not replace spousal support and child maintenance, Prime Minister. Across the country there is no national standard to address the homelessness crisis amidst this pandemic, leaving communities at heightened risk from COVID-19. Canadians who are homeless or living in substandard housing have no access to bathroom facilities for basic hygiene. Those living in crowded SROs and shelters cannot practise social distancing. The problem is particularly acute in my riding in the Downtown Eastside. While the B.C. government has implemented an initiative to house some of the homeless population in empty hotels in the short term, support from the federal government is needed to secure permanent solutions post-COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister commit to providing matching funds and take the right to adequate housing seriously? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: I know that the honourable member wouldn't want to inadvertently mislead the House. The fact is, the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities, including renting new spaces, to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of COVID-19. I recognize there's always more to do, but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy, we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians, and we will continue to do that. Ms. Jenny Kwan: The Prime Minister must know that the money the federal government sent is deficient. Many people still remain homeless, and they are at risk. Cutting chronic homelessness by 50% over the next decade is not good enough, and that is this Prime Minister's national housing strategy. Will the government stop just making empty promises and ensure that every Canadian has the right to housing? Will he top up the support for provinces to at least match their funds? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, cutting chronic homelessness by 50% is an ambitious goal that no one else has ever been able to do as a government, and we are well on track for it. I would suggest that the member opposite not dismiss that as an empty promise, because we have demonstrated actions on it. I recognize there is more to do. There is always more to do. We will be there and continue to be there for vulnerable people, including homeless Canadians. Ms. Jenny Kwan: I would remind the Prime Minister that it was the federal Liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993, so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the Liberals. We in Vancouver East have the third-largest urban indigenous population in the country, yet we got less than 2% of the pandemic urban indigenous housing funding. They're overrepresented among the homeless population. Why? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we recognize there is more to do in supporting urban indigenous people. We have moved forward, both through the Minister of Indigenous Services and the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations. We will continue to work with them, recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in Canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government, and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years. The Chair: Ms. Bergen. Hon. Candice Bergen (PortageLisgar, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, I'm hearing in my riding of PortageLisgar that individuals who are dealing with Service Canada through the mail are experiencing delays. It seems that the mail that's going to Service Canada has not been opened. In fact, one of my constituents sent documents, including a doctor's note, two months ago on March 12 and is now being told that she must resend them because they've never been opened. Can the government tell us whether this is a widespread problem, and how are they dealing with unopened mail at Service Canada? The Chair: The honourable minister. Hon. Ahmed Hussen (Minister of Families, Children and Social Development): Mr. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in Service Canada to meet the expectations of Canadians. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had unprecedented volumes, but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means. We had to close a number of the centres because of COVID-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of Canadians."}

Ahmed Hussen (Minister of Families, Children and Social Development): Mr. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in Service Canada to meet the expectations of Canadians. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had unprecedented volumes, but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means. We had to close a number of the centres because of COVID-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of Canadians. Hon. Candice Bergen: Is the minister aware whether this is a widespread problem? Is this happening rarely, or frequently? I'm hearing about it. I know, from many MPs, we are at the front lines of dealing with and helping constituents who are not only wanting to get support but also are trying to get programs unrelated to COVID-19. Is unopened mail a widespread problem at Service Canada? Hon. Ahmed Hussen: Mr. Chair, I'm happy to look into the particular case that the honourable member brings up. I am not aware of unopened mail being a widespread issue. I'm happy to work with the honourable member to see what happened in this individual case. Hon. Candice Bergen: Thanks very much. Mr. Chair, the Iver Johnson single-shot rifle is a standard farm gun used by many farmers in my riding, in fact, passed down from generation to generation in some cases. Why are the Liberals making this gun illegal? What's the purpose of banning this particular farm rifle? The Chair: The honourable minister. Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I just wish to advise the member that we worked very closely with the Canadian firearms program, with law enforcement and with their firearms verification to identify the makes, models and variants of nine rifles, all of which had in their earliest provenance a design for military use, for soldiers to use in combat. Those are the weapons that have been The Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Bergen. Hon. Candice Bergen: I would challenge the minister on that. I do not believe that he has been consulting with front-line officers. We're hearing from front-line officers that they are concerned about gangs, drug dealers and illegal weapons being smuggled across the border. They are not concerned with these types of farm rifles that are being used by our farmers and, in some cases, hunters. These are specifically used for hunting. So, Mr. Chair, we'd like to see the evidence on why the Liberals are once again targeting law-abiding Canadians, ignoring gangsters and drug dealers. Why are they banning the Iver Johnson? Hon. Bill Blair: It's a great opportunity, I think, when the member opposite says what the police are saying. Let's hear what the police are saying. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles, except for law enforcement and military purposes. The Ontario police leaders said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed rifles. They said, In our view, these weapons have no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by Canada's military and law enforcement. The Chair: Ms. Bergen, we have about 50 seconds left. Hon. Candice Bergen: Mr. Chair, we've seen this before, where the Liberals introduced a long-gun registry that cost billions of dollars and did absolutely nothing to stop violent crimes. This is a repeat of what the Liberals have done before. Is the minister saying that the Iver Johnson that farmers use is an assault rifle? Hon. Bill Blair: Actually, what I'm saying, and what our regulations say very clearly, is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in Canadian society. I would also advise the member that any Canadian killed by gun violence is one too many. We have far too many tragedies where these types of weapons have been used to kill Canadians. The Chair: We'll now continue with Mr.Rayes. Mr. Alain Rayes (RichmondArthabaska, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. My question is for the Prime Minister. Is it true that Canada Revenue Agency employees who process applications for the Canada emergency response benefit, or CERB, have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected, as was pointed out in a national media report today? Hon. Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue): Mr.Chair, our government considers these to be very difficult times for Canadians. We're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries. I'm very proud of the public servants who work at the Canada Revenue Agency. Nearly sevenmillion Mr. Alain Rayes: I repeat my question, which is extremely simple: Is it true that the Canada Revenue Agency sent a memo to its employees asking them to ignore the fraudsters and still send the CERB payments?? Hon. Diane Lebouthillier: I'll finish my response, which was interrupted: Nearly 7.8million Canadians have applied for the Canada emergency response benefit. The priority is for Canadians to be able to pay for their groceries and their housing.

Hon. Diane Lebouthillier: The answer is no. Mr. Alain Rayes: The CERB has been distributed since March25, so for seven weeks now. The federal government website clearly states that if an employee returns to work, the employee must pay back the CERB. Can the Prime Minister tell us whether employees who decide to return to work have to pay back the full $2,000per month, or only $500for week of the month? Hon. Diane Lebouthillier: As I mentioned, we believe that Canadians are going through a very difficult time, and we need to support them. We need to help people pay for their groceries and their housing. That's what our government is committed to, and that's what we'll continue to do. Mr. Alain Rayes: Mr.Chair, the extremely simple question I am asking the Minister comes from companies and workers. None of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters, even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency. So let me repeat my question; I don't think there can be a simpler one. The answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the Canada emergency wage subsidy. If an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the CERB, must he reimburse $500for each week he works during the month, or the entire $2,000? Hon. Carla Qualtrough (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion): Mr. Chair, I can clarify that Service Canada will work closely with anybody who transitions either from the CERB to the wage subsidy or from the CERB back to employment to ensure that there's no overpayment, but of course that there's no undue hardship on the individual. Mr. Alain Rayes: That announcement was made seven weeks ago. The workers want to know how much they have to reimburse. The companies want to know the situation so that they can make decisions on salary assistance. It seems to me that my question is not complicated: do people have to reimburse $500for each week they work in a month, or the full monthly amount of $2,000? Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Mr. Chair, that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker. That's why Service Canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them. I can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation. I recognize that there is some uncertainty, but we're trying to address that. Thank you. The Chair: Mr.Rayes, you have 35seconds left. Mr. Alain Rayes: The answers that we are getting today are incredible. This is unacceptable, in my view. If an employer complies with the hygiene conditions, can employees still refuse to return to work, and therefore continue to receive the CERB? Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Mr. Chair, I can assure all Canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces, we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe. There are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work, and at the end of the day the CERB is there for workers who aren't working due to COVID-19. The Chair: We're going to have to go on from here. The next question will come from Mr. Schmale. Mr. Jamie Schmale (HaliburtonKawartha LakesBrock, CPC): Thank you, Chair. The Wet'suwet'en elected chiefs and community members have been excluded from negotiations on a memorandum of understanding affecting land rights and titles. Only a few hereditary chiefs have been part of these secret negotiations. The elected chiefs have issued a press release asking for the government to halt the joint announcement scheduled for May 14 on the MOU until the community has had a chance to look at and understand how the MOU will affect them. Will the minister agree with the democratically elected chiefs and the Wet'suwet'en people they represent and delay any announcement until proper consultation can be completed?

Carolyn Bennett (Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations): I want to reassure the member that communication is ongoing with and between our partners on how to go forward on implementing the Wet'suwet'en rights and title with a Wet'suwet'en-led solution. We encourage the leaders to continue their ongoing, necessary and important conversations with their community on how they want to proceed on a path toward implementing their rights and title. As we work to rebuild Canada's relationship with the Wet'suwet'en, we need to give them space for these important discussions. Mr. Jamie Schmale: Minister, is that a yes that the signing will be delayed until the elected chiefs have a chance to look at the agreement? Hon. Carolyn Bennett: I believe the elected chiefs have had a look at the agreement. These are very difficult conversations on complex issues around rights and title. This has been outstanding for a long time Mr. Jamie Schmale: The current health crisis should not be used as an opportunity to sideline the Wet'suwet'en people and their elected chiefs. The federal government should be bringing the community together rather than actively excluding Wet'suwet'en members. The chiefs are so concerned that they are now calling for the resignation of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations for failure to engage in proper consultations, which has stoked divisions within the community.

Carolyn Bennett: Yet again, it's very important the member understand the engagement must take place and be led by the Wet'suwet'en nation. That means the elected chiefs and the hereditary chiefs need to work with all clan members as they determine how they wish to work with Canada and the Province of British Columbia to implement the rights and title of the Wet'suwet'en people. Mr. Jamie Schmale: I agree that the Wet'suwet'en should have the opportunity to look at the proposed agreement, but we are still seeing news coming out of the elected chiefs and the people they represent that they have not had a thorough chance to look at this proposed agreement. Will the minister delay the signing? Hon. Carolyn Bennett: I think the member will agree that there's a lot more work to do with all the parties. I believe, in terms of the kind of engagement that has taken place in the feast houses and the notification that took place even before COVID-19, that the work is under way and it will have to be Wet'suwet'en-led in terms of what eventually will be their choice as to how they implement their rights and title. Mr. Jamie Schmale: Mr. Chair, for two weeks now the Liberals on the indigenous affairs committee have shut down Conservatives and witnesses every time we mention the word Wet'suwet'en. They don't want to talk about the issue, an issue that is very much aggravated by the COVID-19 crisis. The Liberals profess to be the advocates for indigenous communities and the champions of reconciliation. Can the minister tell us why the Liberals are determined to shut down discussion and public debate? Hon. Carolyn Bennett: I would have to disagree with the member. I don't believe that there's, at any time, an interest in shutting down discussion or debate. I think, though, that at the COVID committee the issues facing indigenous communities, first nations, Inuit and Mtis around COVID-19 are very important to them. We need to work with them to make sure they can keep their communities safe. The Chair: Mr. Schmale, you have 30 seconds. Mr. Jamie Schmale: I would argue with the minister and challenge her to talk to her committee members. Each time Conservatives have brought up the topic of the Wet'suwet'en and the situation happening with the elected chiefs and the people they represent, we have been shut down every single time. When will the minister allow the public debate to happen? Hon. Carolyn Bennett: Again, in a committee, it is the work of the committee and the decision of the committee. I believe the chair and all members want first nations, Inuit and Mtis to be able to keep their communities safe during COVID-19. The Chair: The next question goes to Mrs. Kusie. Mrs. Stephanie Kusie (Calgary Midnapore, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. It has been three months since this pandemic started and the Liberals just got around to announcing help for seniors. Seniors are a priority and should be treated as such. Why do the Liberals treat seniors as an afterthought? The Chair: The honourable minister. Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors): Thank you very much. There is definitely an interest in and support for our seniors. We've been working to support seniors since the very beginning of this pandemic. I've just had the opportunity to introduce additional measures today wherein we are introducing a one-time special payment for those who receive OAS. Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: Nearly two months into living in some form of isolation, watching their retirement savings take a hit and having to take additional health precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, eligible seniors are set to receive a one-time payment of up to $500. Why does this government consistently undervalue seniors compared with everyone else? Hon. Deb Schulte: I just want to make sure that my honourable colleague remembers that we have already given a GST top-up of almost $375 for single seniors and over $500 for couples. This is in addition to what we've just done today where, as you said, it's $500. Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: According to Abacus Data, 69% of Canadians feel that there will be a second wave in the pandemic, and 52% of Canadians believe that there is a shortage of medical equipment, including personal protective equipment. Given these surprising figures, what is the government's plan to bring in enough personal protective equipment, should there be a second wave of the pandemic? Hon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement): Our government is aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies that Canada needs, from a diverse range of suppliers around the world and here at home. We're working directly with businesses across the country to rapidly scale up domestic production capacity to meet current and future needs. At this point, our primary focus is on front-line health care professionals, but we are also exploring federal government assistance in areas of essential services so that PPE exists where workers need it. We are following public health guidance on this issue in looking to see where we can best assist. Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: According to Public Services and Procurement Canada, despite 1.8 billion units of PPE being procured, less than 6% of N95 respirator orders have been filled, less than 8% of surgical mask orders have been filled, and just 1.4% of face shield orders have been filled.

Anita Anand: Let me start by saying that we are working in an incredibly difficult and competitive global environment and are procuring millions of items: face shields, gowns, hand sanitizer, and N95 surgical masks, and ventilators every single day. There is a delay in the production of these goods, but we have had many deliveries coming into Canada, including over two million face shields The Chair: We'll have to go back to Mrs. Kusie. Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: A national security expert from the University of Ottawa has said that the national emergency strategic stockpile has failed in the current crisis, resulting in some provinces such as Saskatchewan using expired PPE, and provinces such as Alberta using faulty PPE that cause rashes and headaches. What is the government doing to expedite procurement and to counter the risk of faulty PPE, given that 34 of the suppliers are from China, which has already supplied significant faulty PPE? Hon. Anita Anand: I will start by saying that we have multiple supply chains operating at the same time, from China, and domestically, and from the United States and other countries around the world. Our first priority is to make sure that we get safe, effective equipment and supplies into the hands of our front-line health care workers. Given the global supply chains and their competitive nature, this is an ongoing project and we are having success for our front-line health care workers. The Chair: We'll now go on to the next question from Mr. d'Entremont. Mr. Chris d'Entremont (West Nova, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Ten weeks ago the Minister of Fisheries, in responding to my question in question period, acknowledged that the lobster fishery was being negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and was facing losses of up to 95% of its Asian markets. Mr. Chair, on April 28 I asked the minister what she was doing to support harvesters who were left out of the $62.5 million aid package. She mentioned that she was looking at sector-specific areas to make sure that the issues were addressed. Can the minister tell us what the government's plan is to directly support seafood harvesters? The Chair: The honourable minister. Hon. Bernadette Jordan (Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thank my colleague for that very good question. We know that the fish and seafood sector has been extremely adversely affected because of COVID-19. We've started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB is available for seasonal workers as well as people who have run out of their fishery EI, but we know that more needs to be done. The fishery enterprises are uniquely structured, which is why we're looking at measures to address the concerns they have. I'm working with my provincial colleagues, as well as my caucus colleagues. Mr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr. Chair, most fishermen are not eligible for the wage subsidy program due to the stipulation that it cannot be used for employees who are related to their employer. Most fishing enterprises, like farm enterprises, are family oriented. Many fishermen have their wives, their sons, their uncles or their fathers working for them, and sometimes it's the whole family on the boat. Can the minister explain what the government's plan is to support fishermen who do not fit into any actual program and who desperately need direct financial help from the federal government to survive? Hon. Bernadette Jordan: Mr. Chair, we know that, because of the unique structure of fishing enterprises, they are not eligible for many of the supports we have put in place. We have made changes to the CERB to make sure that people who run out of the fishers EI are eligible as well as seasonable workers. We know that more needs to be done for the harvesters directly. We are working on direct supports. We have put in place measures to address processors' concerns so that harvesters continue to have a place to sell their product. We know that more has to be done. I am working with my cabinet colleagues to find solutions, and I hope I will have more to say about that very soon. Mr. Chris d'Entremont: In recent weeks, lobster fishermen in the gulf region of the Maritimes were shocked to read an additional subsection of regulations that was added to their fishing conditions for the 2021 fishing season. This addition was for a catch limitation or quota to which none of the harvesters or advisory members were privy. This created quite a chill within the lobster fishery, for sure. Can the minister tell us how these detailed regulations managed to get added without her authorization, and can licence-holders expect to see these same regulations in their conditions when their season gets going in the future? Hon. Bernadette Jordan: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the people who brought to my attention the conditions that were put on licences in the gulf. Those were not done under my authorization. They were removed right away from the condition of licence, and they will not happen. Mr. Chris d'Entremont: My next question is for the Minister of Health. Mr. Chair, on Wednesday, February 26, after the death of 23-year-old Chantelle Lindsay from Nova Scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis, I asked the Prime Minister whether the government was going to make Trikafta, which might have saved Chantelle's life, available to Canadians. Now that almost 12 weeks have passed, we understand that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to Health Canada for study. Many of my Conservative colleagues and I have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with Vertex. Can the Minister of Health tell us when this drug will be available to CF patients in Canada? The Chair: Honourable minister, the floor is yours. Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. My heart goes out to the family of Chantelle, who are obviously suffering an unbearable loss. I agree with the member that we want to make sure that effective drugs are available in Canada. As the member has pointed out, Vertex has not applied to sell Trikafta in Canada. However, there is the special access program that makes drugs like Trikafta available. In fact, the majority of people who have applied through the special access program to get access to the drug have received access. I would encourage the member to continue his correspondence with the manufacturer, as will we. The Chair: Mr. d'Entremont, you have 36 seconds. Mr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr.Chair, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals are having to deal with considerable losses of income. In my constituency, tens of thousands of tourists use the ferry between Bar Harbor, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. What is the government planning to do to help the ferry to survive and to resume service next season, if the borders remain closed this summer?"}

In light of the new funding for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, I will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector. The Chair: Mr.Savard-Tremblay, the floor is now yours. Mr. Simon-Pierre Savard-Tremblay (Saint-HyacintheBagot, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Despite all the upheaval it causes, the crisis we are experiencing, considerable in scope though it is, can also be an opportunity to begin a transition. What is essential in normal times may, during a crisis, become crucial. What is unjust may, in times of crisis, become frankly scandalous. In Quebec, we are generally allergic to blatant injustice and inequality. Yesterday, Ottawa announced new support for large companies. Many of us in Quebec feel that, when a company knocks on the state's door to ask for assistance, it is totally legitimate for the state to impose conditions before providing its support. We in the Bloc Qubcois feel that there should be a limit, a ceiling, on the assistance provided to large companies, in order to avoid abuses in executive compensation. That is also the prevalent position in Quebec. A few years ago, after the Bombardier affair in QuebecI will not dwell on that because Quebecers are all too familiar with itthree of the four political parties that sat in the National Assembly and that still sit these took a position of that kind. A number of civil society groups in Quebec share it also. The United States, which, you will agree, is no bastion of socialism, has already implemented similar policies for periods of crisis. The idea is to offer support, but with conditions. According to a report published by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives on January2, the 100highest-paid CEOs in Canada earned 227times more in 2018 than the average worker. The average salary for workers increased by 2.6% between 2017 and 2018. Given that inflation was then at 2.3%, it can be said that there was practically no increase. By contrast, the salary increase for CEOs in the same period was 18%, even in cases where the companies suffered losses. Let us be clear that we were not in a crisis when that study was conducted. We cannot even imagine what the figures are today. At this point, we are no longer talking about a gap but an abyss. Wealth is concentrated at the top of the pyramid, but clearly does not flow down to the base. Does the government intend to put a ceiling on executive compensation to ensure that they are not the only ones to profits from the support at this time of crisis? The question is clear and I am asking you to give me a clear answer. If I don't get one, I am going to have to demand a new version of the Clarity Act. The Chair: The honourable Minister has the floor. I would also like to remind members to ask their questions through the Chair Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance): Thank you, Mr.Chair. We know that our approach has to help small and medium-size companies, but also large companies in order to provide a bridge to the end of the crisis. In our opinion, that is very important. It will protect the jobs of Canadians and the future of our economy. That's why the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility is very important. That said, we know that it is necessary and important to impose conditions. Yes, we do want to make sure that the facility is available for companies that are going to continue to support our economy, to protect their employees, and to make a significant contribution to our communities. That is why we have attached a number of major conditions to our approach. We will have more details on the subject in the coming days. We established from the outset that we had to impose conditions on executive compensation. That is very important. We are going to consider the rules and conditions that are needed in order for the facility to be available to the companies, the operations and the employees. Of course, conditions are required to ensure that the facility is available for operations, not for dividends or share buybacks, for example. We will impose conditions of that kind. We also want to make sure that we are aware of the situation the companies are in. For example, we want to be sure that they are not engaged in tax evasion. The Chair: We'll now go on to Ms. Sgro. Hon. Judy A. Sgro (Humber RiverBlack Creek, Lib.): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I appreciate the opportunity. I will be sharing my time with the member for KingsHants. Canadian seniors are worried about COVID-19. In my own riding of Humber RiverBlack Creek, 30% of the population are 65 or older. We know they are one of the highest risk populations. During this time, their costs have gone up. They have had to spend extra on medication and grocery delivery, as many cannot leave their homes. I have also heard of many seniors who are facing extra dispensing fees. These costs all add up, and many seniors were already carefully budgeting before the pandemic. It is so important that our government be there to support them. Can the minister please tell us what our government is doing to ensure that vulnerable seniors get the support they need during this very difficult time? The Chair: The honourable minister. Hon. Deb Schulte: My colleague is right. Seniors have faced increased costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our government today has responded to that with additional action. We announced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for seniors eligible for GIS. This means there will be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time. Beyond this, we announced $20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that will help seniorsfor example, to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected. We've worked tirelessly on this as well as on other recent measures like the GST credit to help the most vulnerable seniors. Thank you to my colleague for her advocacy. The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)): You have 30 seconds left, Ms. Sgro. Go ahead with a short question and a response. Hon. Judy A. Sgro: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I want to applaud the minister for that work. I know she's been working extremely hard to make sure that we get some additional announcements over and above all of the ones we have already made, so congratulations. Keep up the work. You know there is lots more we want to do. The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Please give a short response. Go ahead. Hon. Deb Schulte: Thank you very much to my honourable colleague for her advocacy. Thanks for everyone's advocacy. Seniors across the country have been communicating with us and letting us know their needs, and we have been responding. The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now I'll go over to Mr. Blois. Go ahead. Mr. Kody Blois (KingsHants, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's always a privilege to have a chance to speak on issues that matter to Canadians, whether it's from the floor of the House of Commons or, indeed, from my house here in Nova Scotia. It's great to see everyone across the country. Like my colleagues, I'd like to thank the staff of the House of Commons for their continued work to make sure that we have this forum to be able to continue the democratic process. I would also quickly like to thank my staff both here locally in KingsHants and in Ottawa for their continued work for my constituents. Mr. Chair, my question through you is to the minister of agriculture. In KingsHants, agriculture is an important economic driver for our economy. We have the greatest concentration of agriculture producers east of Montreal. From our beef industry to our wine industry and everything in-between, it is extremely important. We have the Kentville Research and Development Centre and the Hants County agricultural exhibition, the longest-standing exhibition in North America. We know that COVID-19 has had impacts on the agriculture industry to differing degrees. In particular, KingsHants is home to an important dairy sector. We also have a growing and important horticulture sector. Can the minister specifically provide an update to the House on the measures our government has taken on those two particular commodity groups that are so important in my riding? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister. Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Thank you, Mr. Chair. We are targeting support to some of the most critical challenges facing the food supply chain. Last Tuesday I was proud to announce our emergency processing fund for a total of $77.5 million, $50 million for the surplus food program and $125 million through AgriRecovery to support our beef and pork producers. Concerning the dairy sector in particular, I'm hopeful that tomorrow we will get the support of all of the parties to be able to respond to their request for an increase in their loan capacity from $300 million to $500 million. I would like to encourage all farmers to apply to the business risk management programs, including AgriStability, for which we have improved some of the mechanisms."}

The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go on with questions, but I'll also just ask Mr. Blois to excuse me for mispronouncing his name. Let's go now to Mr. Masse for Windsor West. Go ahead, Mr. Masse. Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP): During the COVID-19 pandemic, the State of Michigan has become an epicentre of the outbreak. The city of Detroit alone has more deaths than the entire province of Ontario. The border communities of Sarnia and Windsor have higher per capita infection rates than the rest of the province. Next week, the border restrictions between the U.S. and Canada expire. With the premiers of B.C., Quebec and Ontario opposing the opening of the border at this time, will the restrictions be extended, or is the Prime Minister discussing changing the restrictions? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister. Hon. Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs): Let me assure the honourable member that, first and foremost, all decisions about Canada's border are taken by Canadians and with the health and safety of Canadians first and foremost in mind. When it comes to the current agreement's coming up next week, we are in very close conversations with Americans about next steps. Mr. Brian Masse: What changes are on the table? Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Let me just be clear that I didn't speak about any changes; I spoke about a very collaborative conversation with our American neighbours about next steps. Mr. Brian Masse: Are you discussing any changes to the current status right now? Hon. Chrystia Freeland: I found during the NAFTA negotiations that negotiations are best not conducted in public, but let me just assure Canadians that the health and safety of Canadians is first and foremost. Our government is taking a cautious approach, and we're working effectively. Mr. Brian Masse: This is not negotiation. This is whether there are changes on the table. What are they? Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Let me just say that I think the honourable member was actually seeking to know what exactly is being discussed with our American partners. Let me just say that we are taking a very cautious approach to the health and safety of Canadians. A very collaborative discussion is happening. Mr. Brian Masse: Will more information be shared between your government and the American government on Canadians and Americans crossing the border on both sides? Hon. Chrystia Freeland: I'm not sure what the member is alluding to, but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well. Non-essential travel is down very sharply. Essential travel, particularly for trade, continues, and that's a good thing, too. Mr. Brian Masse: With border communities having more rates of infection, will they receive additional PPE and financial assistance to deal with the loosening of current border restrictions that is being discussed? Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Let me just emphasize to the honourable member that on a couple of occasions he has implied that a loosening of the current restrictions is being discussed. Let me be very clear that this is his assertion; I have not said that. Mr. Brian Masse: Apparently, we're meeting for nothing. I'll move to the large commercial banks who are profiteering off or squeezing Canadians during this public crisis. Credit card interest rates are still high from previous price-gouging levels. Despite numerous favours from the Liberals, there have not been significant changes. Vancity Savings Credit Union demonstrated leadership when it set credit card rates at zero. Will the government use its statutory powers and force the banks to offer the credit card relief that Vancity has already done? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister. Hon. Bill Morneau: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to say that we recognize the challenges that Canadians face, especially with issues like credit card rates. That's exactly why we've been working on this issue since we came into office. We came to an agreement on interchange fees that was important for consumers. Most recently, during the COVID-19 crisis, we've negotiated with the banks and encouraged them, and they have come out with reductions in their credit card fees that are significant, and deferrals for customers"}

Hon. Bill Morneau: As I've said, Mr. Chair, we're continuing to support consumers. We're continuing to work together with banks to make sure that they are giving the kind of support necessary to their customers, and we've seen actions in this regard, supporting customers. Mr. Brian Masse: Why do banks have to profit at higher interest rates on Canadian consumer and retailer exchange rates during COVID-19? Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think it's important to clarify that banks have come forward and given deferrals to customers in trouble and cut their interest by half  Mr. Brian Masse: Not on credit cards.  Hon. Bill Morneau: and that's been important on credit cards. The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): There's time for one more short question. Go ahead, Mr. Masse. Mr. Brian Masse: Will the minister use his powers if the banks continue to charge Canadian consumers interest rates that are higher than Vancity's? Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, again, we will continue to work with banks to ensure that they're supporting their customers. What banks have done on credit cards by cutting their fees in half is an important nod in that direction. Mr. Bruce Stanton: Next, we have Jacques Gourde. Mr. Jacques Gourde (LvisLotbinire, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Quebec is Canada's biggest producer of hydroelectricity, a renewable energy that is the pride of the Quebec nation. The only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of Quebec, in Ontario, for instance. This competitively priced power could help us reduce our environmental footprint and further cut greenhouse gas emissions. Will the government show leadership and allow Canada's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor, as we proposed? Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we are continuing to work towards that end. It is always very important to protect Canadians, and we are going to stick to that approach. Mr. Jacques Gourde: Mr.Chair, Canada's dairy processors have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis and the new CanadaU.S.Mexico Agreement, or CUSMA. Some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10% to 50%, depending on the processed product. Will the government commit to granting import permits under CUSMA to Canada's dairy processors, not retailers directly? Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr.Chair, I can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation. I should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new NAFTA. That is important to Canada and Quebec, and I'm very pleased that we were able to do that. Mr. Jacques Gourde: Mr.Chair, the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand. Canada's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers, while contributing $19billion to GDP. Now those very processors are being asked to try to export Canadian value-added products. Will the minister commit to giving Canada's dairy processors import permits, instead of encouraging American multinationals? Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for his question. I fully understand, as we all do, the important role processors play in our system and our country. I can assure the members of the House that we will continue to work with Canadian processors as the agreement comes into force. Mr. Jacques Gourde: Mr.Chair, when it comes to the COVID-19 crisis, what Canadians will remember is that those with access to reliable high-speed Internet will have fared better, feeling less financial strain, than those who are cut off from the rest of the world. Is the government ready to invest in making high-speed Internet available to all Canadians, no matter where they live in the country? Hon. Maryam Monsef: Yes, we are, Mr. Chair. Mr. Jacques Gourde: Mr.Chair, the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of Canada's tourism industry. The pain will be felt by thousands of Canadians, who will have to find new jobs in order to survive. Is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens?"}

Mlanie Joly: Yes, I look forward to working with my fellow member on this issue. I know the tourism sector is important to him and, especially, his constituents. Let's work together to find ways to get this hard-hit sector moving again. Many people have lost their jobs and need assistance from the government. That is why we're here, providing a helping hand at this difficult time so they can come out the other side. The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Continuing with questions, we'll go to the honourable member for SaskatoonUniversity, Mr. Tochor. Mr. Corey Tochor (SaskatoonUniversity, CPC): Good afternoon, everybody. With respect to entering Canada, does the government consider spousal reunification as essential travel, yes or no? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister. Hon. Bill Blair: The CBSA has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-Canadian citizen, who has no status in Canada, attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential. They are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel. Mr. Corey Tochor: Respectfully to the minister, you're letting down Canadians. People are being stranded, and you need to do better as a government.  Changing gears a little, all Canadians would agree, or can agree, that the Prime Minister requires suitable accommodation. Why did the government simply not tell Canadians that the Harrington cottage needed to be rebuilt and massively expanded? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I would ask the honourable members to direct their questions through the chair. The honourable minister. Hon. Anita Anand: The NCC is an independent Crown corporation. It recognizes the importance of the official residences it has jurisdiction over. The work at Harrington Lake is part of a broader program to preserve and maintain and restore all official residences under NCC management, and we will support the NCC in its important work. Mr. Corey Tochor: Was there something in particular that this government did not want Canadians to know about the cottage, or is secrecy all this government knows how to do? Hon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, this information was and has been public since 2018. There is no effort to hide any information from the public in this regard. Mr. Corey Tochor: Respectfully, Canadians feel misled on this, and we're not clear on what the expenses were, how large an expansion it was The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Go ahead, the honourable government House leader. Hon. Pablo Rodriguez: On a point of order, Mr. Chair, I believe this has absolutely nothing to do with the pandemic, so the questions are out of order, in my opinion. Thank you. The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I thank the honourable government House leader for his comment. Certainly the scope of the special committee on the COVID-19 pandemic does expect and anticipate that the subject matter will be related to the matter at hand, so I would ask honourable members to continue to keep within those bounds. Of course, members will also know that we're unable to gauge that until members have spoken, so I would ask members to keep on subject. Let's go back to Mr. Tochor to finish his question, and we have about two minutes remaining in this spot. Mr. Corey Tochor: Yes, thank you, Chair. The point I was making was about transparency or lack of transparency that is hurting our efforts with COVID-19. Changing gears onto CERB, who came up with the number for CERB? Why is it $2,000? A senior gets $1,200, people with disabilities get $1,600, and now we've added another ad hoc program on top of those.

The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Your last question, Mr. Tochor. Mr. Corey Tochor: I have a really quick question, which I've heard in my office, on charities and non-profits that do not have their own payroll number and are ineligible for the wage subsidy. Does the Prime Minister have a program fix coming so that charities and non-profits can receive the wage subsidy? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister. Hon. Ahmed Hussen: Mr. Chair, we understand the important role that charities and non-profits are playing to help vulnerable Canadians at this difficult time. We have announced supports in the amount of $350 million to ensure that not only do they continue that great work, but also expand it to serve the most vulnerable to get through the COVID-19 pandemic. The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Okay. We will move to the next questioner, Mr. Aboultaif from Edmonton Manning. Mr. Aboultaif, go ahead with your question. Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, last week markets were shocked when leaks regarding the state of our economy came to light before the market even opened. This caused worry to investors at home and abroad about the integrity of our markets and the nature of the leak, which is, in itself, unprecedented. Section 34 of the Statistics Act indicates the following:     Every person who, after taking the oath set out in subsection 6, is guity of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or to impreisonment for a term not exceeing five years or both:       wilfully discloses or divulges directly or indirectly to any person not entitled under this Act to receive the same any information obtained by him in the course of his employment that might exert an influence on or affect the market value of any stocks, bonds or other security or any product or article, or       uses any information described in paragraph for the purpose of speculating in any stocks, bonds or other security or any product or article   My question for the minister is this: Does the government consider this case to be subject to paragraph 34 or 34 and a criminal offence, yes or no? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister. Hon. Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry): Mr. Chair, my hon. colleague is absolutely right that the current situation with regard to the COVID crisis is deeply problematic, and we want to make sure that any information we share with the Canadian public with regard to economic measures or labour market numbers follows the appropriate process. The breach that occurred is completely unacceptable. Our government has denounced this breach. That breach was not the way to deal with such sensitive information. The member has alluded to several paragraphs within the Statistics Act. I can assure him that we are looking into this matter and that Statistics Canada is looking into this issue as well. Going forward, we will ensure that such a breach does not occur again, because it's important that we continue to have the confidence of Canadians during this current health care crisis. Mr. Ziad Aboultaif: Okay, I will take that as a yes. So this matter should be investigated, yes or no? Hon. Navdeep Bains: As I have indicated very clearly, what has happened is completely unacceptable. This breach should not have occurred. This matter is being looked into, and we want to assure Canadians going forward that The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Back to Mr. Aboultaif. Mr. Ziad Aboultaif: In that case, the minister said the matter will be looked into. Basically, my understanding of this case is that Statistics Canada is going to investigate itself, or does the minister think that the government should refer this to the RCMP? Hon. Navdeep Bains: Sorry, could you repeat that question? I had a bit of an issue and could not hear the question. Mr. Ziad Aboultaif: Will Statistics Canada investigate itself or will the government refer this to the RCMP? Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, there are appropriate protocols in place to look into such breaches. Those protocols will be followed, and the appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such breaches do not occur going forward."}

So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . Project Manager: Oh . Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah I'm sure  . Project Manager: Maybe , I hope so . User Interface: Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's true . User Interface: Um , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . Project Manager: Chan User Interface: So it's quite convenient for user to use it . Project Manager: Yeah , okay , but don't touch  don't destroy your prototype . User Interface: Yeah , s User Interface: okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so Project Manager: Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom . Industrial Designer: Yeah  . User Interface: Yeah , everything's mushroom . Mush Mushroom design , yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh  like lemon shape , you know , centre  is yellow and t d User Interface: Yeah Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . Industrial Designer: To integrate , you know  yeah . Industrial Designer: I don't think   I hope nobody will eat it  You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the  the  in Project Manager: Oh . User Interface: Yeah Marketing: Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits  yeah .  Yeah . Project Manager: Fruits and vegetables . Industrial Designer: Really ? But  Fruit and vegetable , Project Manager: Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable . Industrial Designer: so mushroom was a kind of you know  uh User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: I don't think it is . Project Manager: It's vegetable . Industrial Designer: Mushroom ? User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: Oh , uh I'm not sure . Project Manager: So th it's something eatable . Industrial Designer: We can  it's a veg a kind of vegetable , Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: but you know we we integrated them with different colour . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable  you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . Marketing: No , I mean , yeah  yeah . Inspira inspiration is Industrial Designer: And inspired colour Industrial Designer: and  and very sophisticated material , so . Marketing: True . Industrial Designer: And so User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Next slide . User Interface: Uh , no this our only two slides . Industrial Designer: So what we w what I can add is that , you know  he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , User Interface: Yeah . Industrial Designer: it is a low level chip , and User Interface: So we cut it to see . Industrial Designer: You know , we don't need to k  . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: You know wi  the low level chips inside and you know the LCD button and the i User Interface: Okay . So where's the battery battery ? Industrial Designer: The battery it is under  . Project Manager: In the base . Industrial Designer: It is in th in  in the base , yeah . Project Manager: In the basement . In the basement . User Interface: Base . Here ? Project Manager: And where is the solar solar cell ? Marketing: But we say uh we sa we said solar . Project Manager: Where is the solar cell ? Industrial Designer: In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and Project Manager: Oh . Do you think it won't be  It won't cris increase the price ? User Interface: Okay Industrial Designer: I don't think so , Project Manager: Okay , we'll see after . Industrial Designer: but it it's might be okay , so . Project Manager: We will have first to Industrial Designer: I it might be okay . So Project Manager: so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? Marketing: Yeah . Marketing: I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about  uh Marketing: we had three keys   key points to uh for this remote control design , Marketing: and first one was uh Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Marketing: fancy look and feel . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . Marketing: Uh just let me check . Industrial Designer: So , four point  three point five , it means it's acceptable . Marketing: One one being true , and seven being false . Okay . Industrial Designer: Oops . Marketing: Ouch . So User Interface: Okay . Marketing: Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? User Interface: Yeah , I think so . Industrial Designer: I think you have nice colours .  I don't Marketing: But is it Industrial Designer: The sha the bowl shape people like ."}

User Interface: then the angle you stop is the angle you  is the channel you Marketing: Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? User Interface: It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the Marketing: So you you count  one degree , two degrees , no . User Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .

Marketing: Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's  yeah but it  I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . Industrial Designer: Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ Project Manager: Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . Marketing: Mm . Industrial Designer: Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so Marketing: Yeah . User Interface: Mm . Project Manager: So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , User Interface: So we have to give a Project Manager: so we have the slogan too . User Interface: So we have give him  give it a cute name . Project Manager: Yeah Project Manager: th no , it's the it's the pineapple control  remote control . User Interface: Mush mushroom controller . Marketing: Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . Project Manager: It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . Industrial Designer: It's not a mushroom .  It's a pineapple remote controls . Marketing: It's not the trend . Project Manager: Pineapple . User Interface: Pa Pine apple . Industrial Designer: Yeah , pineapple remote remote control . Marketing: Yeah , but just flying saucer , or Project Manager: With cherry on top . Industrial Designer: Oh , that User Interface: Okay . Marketing: I would say flying saucer . Industrial Designer: Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so Marketing: It's more appropriate , somehow . User Interface: Okay . Industrial Designer: That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine . User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: Will you buy one ? Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah I will try  I'll try User Interface: Okay . Marketing: Mm . Project Manager: Try to . Okay uh User Interface: Twenty five  Euro . Industrial Designer: . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage User Interface: Okay . Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your TV Industrial Designer: Yeah I always lose my  Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my TV , so it would be User Interface: so you need to buy one . Project Manager: One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . User Interface: Okay . Marketing: Mm . User Interface: Traditional one ? Yeah . So this one and this one . What do you choose ? Project Manager: I prefer the laser remote control .  No . Industrial Designer: I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's User Interface: What do you choose ? Okay . Industrial Designer: it's will enlight your house , your home and your TV , so . User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd  can put light inside . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . Marketing: Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: We had some problems  going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno . Industrial Designer: . Project Manager: I think it it would be interesting to  just to see if we can  if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . Marketing: Yeah , afterwards , if User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Marketing: if it's a new trend . Okay . Project Manager: So Industrial Designer: Yeah that's that fine . So we can celebrate now . That's our new product . Project Manager: Champagne  , mister Baba . Industrial Designer: Yes . Marketing: We should celebrate . Industrial Designer: It's it's fine . It's  I like it  .  Next time . User Interface: So buy one . Industrial Designer: Well , I'll buy one here . User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: So Marketing: Mm . Project Manager: Okay , I will close this . Mm . Industrial Designer: Yeah . No ? Project Manager: So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: and we have a nearly final product . Marketing: Our final prototype which  yeah . Industrial Designer: Final prototype , yeah , ye yeah . User Interface: Prototype , yeah .

What  the first thing  question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that  well it wasn't really my area because  I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one  . Industrial Designer: Um and uh  I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Could I  can I interject to ask a question there , Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: Yeah sure . Marketing: is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the  surrounding it ? Industrial Designer: Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , Marketing: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . Marketing: Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? Industrial Designer: Yeah the the User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: They are . Industrial Designer: well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption Marketing: Oh I see . Industrial Designer: and how much you need to send the data across . Marketing: Okay . Industrial Designer: Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .  Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the  w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the TV unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh  just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . Industrial Designer: It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the  uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would  the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the TV receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to  whatever um whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using and since that that's another use and  reason to use that infrared because that's what all TVs use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the  it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of  d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa  thing that you could have , Marketing: Mm . Mm . User Interface: but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's  it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering  maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will  this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you  you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like  it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh  added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not  of no use of punching in the uh  trying to put in those things in  on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah , Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in  add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's  so this is  if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use  usage and all that . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design . Marketing: Mm . User Interface: Uh any comments like , if you want ? Project Manager: 'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end , User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um Industrial Designer: Yeah sure . Marketing: 'Kay . Project Manager: Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . Oh , God . Right , okay . User Interface: I think you'll have to Marketing: Have I got to keep this here ? User Interface: You can't Marketing: Does it matter ? User Interface: It'll have to  this can't be pulled . Marketing: I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ? Project Manager: We just do the best we can . Marketing: Uh , whoops . User Interface: You'll have to push it a bit more . User Interface: Yep . Project Manager: Ah . Look at that . Marketing: Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .  Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .  Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there .  Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take  said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh  when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this .  I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you , User Interface: 'Kay . Marketing: but I think I'll just keep it simple , Marketing: if there's any more information I can email you extra details , User Interface: That's fine . Project Manager: Okay . Yeah . Industrial Designer: Okay . Marketing: is that okay ? Project Manager: Right , um Industrial Designer: Huh . Project Manager: we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext , User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um  our control is only going to be for TV , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that   it limits the cost for us , User Interface: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . Marketing: Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? Project Manager: It says for TV only , so  looks like it's just Marketing: Just channel-hopping . Project Manager: yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but  I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for TV only . But I mean , general TV controls do do video as well . Marketing: Would that imply video use ? Industrial Designer: T yeah yeah . I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g Project Manager: I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined TV and videos don't you ? Industrial Designer: Yeah . If yeah Marketing: Mm-hmm , yes . Industrial Designer: and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the TV anyway so on to on to like the TV hard drive or so . Project Manager: Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and  programming . User Interface: Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? Marketing: Yes . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , User Interface: Ten perc Project Manager: Mm ."}

User Interface: Pens Industrial Designer: and they're not that great anyway . Marketing: In fact I've just called up that table there , Industrial Designer: Alright , okay . Marketing: we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an LCD screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? Industrial Designer: Alright , okay . Marketing: So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology . Project Manager: Yeah , Industrial Designer: Yeah but um on on that again I just thought  'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is User Interface: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: bu Marketing: Oh yeah . Industrial Designer: so I thought that could be quite a Marketing: Right . Project Manager: We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing Marketing: Mm . Project Manager: um because it is something I  it needs to be  the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager: maybe  on the TV  you could put like a pack on the TV or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the TV and it beeps User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Yes . That's a super idea . Project Manager: but that's  that sounds a lot cheaper to me . Industrial Designer: Hmm . Yeah . Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: Um  the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well . Marketing: Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , Project Manager: Mm . Marketing: you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may  and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs  ? Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Sure . Industrial Designer: Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs User Interface: Alright . Industrial Designer: I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same . User Interface: Right . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . User Interface: The features could be same and the body could look slightly different . Industrial Designer: Just Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: yeah , yeah . Marketing: Mm . User Interface: So Project Manager: What about  you were talking about the buttons , User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers Industrial Designer: 'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just  yeah . Project Manager: yeah ? Um so you  it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the Industrial Designer: No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to  you don't actually have to press them you just Project Manager: You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .

But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um  if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big Project Manager: Were too big . Industrial Designer: because um  they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands Project Manager: Mm . Industrial Designer: so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh  so if you  I don't know what  'cause you  obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .

Yeah , speech recognition , Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: which is extremely expensive , Industrial Designer: but Project Manager: I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue . Industrial Designer: yeah .

Industrial Designer: Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it  you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on Project Manager: Mm . Marketing: Right . Industrial Designer: and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . Marketing: Excellent , mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: So that  yeah . Marketing: Mm . Industrial Designer: But just to have that function would be would be really good . Marketing: Right . Project Manager: Okay so Marketing: Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me ,  to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing TV remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Marketing: Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? Industrial Designer: Mm . Industrial Designer: But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um  the companies who uh who you deal with have actually  they've they've got an obligation to to help you out Marketing: Mm . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: and also  I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having Marketing: Right . Project Manager: The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your TV's not doing it . Taking your TV and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ? Marketing: Alright .  Yes Marketing: If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , Marketing: but I mean for  if there were any more  or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for TV and video , Project Manager: I think so . Industrial Designer: Yeah , I mean Marketing: we're not gonna put any   okay , just a thought . Project Manager: Um Industrial Designer: I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that . Project Manager: Instruction manuals . But I mean they're  there's customer service , Marketing: Okay . Project Manager: there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to Industrial Designer: Yeah . Department , yeah . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Sure . Project Manager: and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um . Marketing: Mm . User Interface: Right . Marketing: Yeah . User Interface: I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to  for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . Industrial Designer: And they're Marketing: Not for such simple functions Industrial Designer: yeah , they should be f yeah . Marketing: because we're focusing on that , Project Manager: Mm . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible Marketing: yes okay . User Interface: Simple . Project Manager: because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Mm ."}

Project Manager: and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . Marketing: Sure , okay . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: Um , what other functions ? We need  I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about  c 'cause you've got the dilemma between  oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? Industrial Designer: Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but Project Manager: Well they la they they last quite a long time , Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: and if you had uh  when you  th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .

Industrial Designer: Yeah on that as well so . User Interface: So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? Project Manager: S Industrial Designer: Yeah Project Manager: Yes . Industrial Designer: some sort of docking station or User Interface: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: Rechargeable with a docking station . Industrial Designer: yeah . Project Manager: So the rechargeable which would be your field . Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine , Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . User Interface: Right . Project Manager: Yes , Marketing: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: which it is cheaper in the long run as well . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Um , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either , Marketing: Mm-hmm . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many   how much you try and make it simple , Marketing: Mm . Project Manager: um Marketing: And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , Project Manager: They do . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely  an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that . Project Manager: Okay so we've got a flip-screen . User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: Um User Interface: What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , Marketing: Mm-hmm . User Interface: and you don't have to  you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . Marketing: Slightly curved , curved . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't Marketing: Mm . Project Manager: 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway . User Interface: y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your Marketing: Mm . User Interface: the way you h hold of  it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay .

User Interface: logo could become as  you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . Project Manager: Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different . Marketing: I think that's   that sounds a really attractive idea , User Interface: A sea shell ? Marketing: I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of  yeah and that opens out into your flip-top . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . I think it's a really nice idea User Interface: Yeah we could look in at that . Marketing: and plus you can get   you know even though we're using plastic , you can still  I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . Project Manager: Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . You could have different kind of casings . Industrial Designer: Mm . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and Marketing: Yeah . Mm-hmm . Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't  not gonna lose it so much  either . It's easier to  bit nice to handle . Project Manager: Mm . User Interface: Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are  whichever appeals the most like , Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Mm-hmm . User Interface: that could be the most common design . Project Manager: Okay . Marketing: Okay . User Interface: But we can like think of five , six designs .

Marketing: So it's no teletext , it's only for TV and by implication video , User Interface: Mm-hmm . Marketing: our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus . Project Manager: That was um in cutting down the number  that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date Marketing: Right . Right . Right , so when they press for programming you  it comes up on the LCD , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and  Or was  is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just  that was an add-on feature ? Project Manager: It's  kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . Marketing: Uh-huh . Right . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? Project Manager: Um it could be it c It  yes , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature , Marketing: Right . Project Manager: you know , drawing attention to that . And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . Marketing: Mm , and the rechargeable batteries . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Was there anything else there that we  in the new new project requirements ? Project Manager: Um User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Mm-hmm . That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at , Project Manager: Yes . Yes . Marketing: what preference  so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . Project Manager: And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um . User Interface: For detection , right . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible .

I think User Interface: Yep , Project Manager: Yep , Marketing: What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? Industrial Designer: Okay .

PhD D: And so Professor F: The , uh , Chuck chunks . PhD D: Yeah . The Chuck chunks . PhD E: Hmm . PhD D: Right . And so he talked it over with the transcriber and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu a number , a digit , and then a beep , uh , at the beginning of each one Professor F: Yeah . Yeah . PhD D: and that would help keep them from getting lost . And , um ,  so Adam wrote a little script to generate those style , uh , beeps PhD C: Where 'd you get the digits from ? PhD D: and so we 're  I came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten . Postdoc A: They sound really good . PhD D: So . Does it sound OK ? PhD G: That 's a great idea . Postdoc A: Yeah . PhD D: So , um  Yeah . We just used those . PhD C: And do you splice them into the  waveform ? Or  ? PhD D: Yeah . He  then he d I recorded  Actually , I recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked . PhD C: Right . Mm - hmm . PhD D: He liked the fastest one , so he just cut those out  and spliced them in between , uh , two beeps . Postdoc A: It sounds like a radio announcer 's voice . Really . PhD E: It will be funny uh Postdoc A: Yeah , yeah . PhD D: Does it ? PhD E: It will be funny when you 're really reading digits , and then there are the chunks with  with your  digits in ? PhD D: Yeah . With my Postdoc A: Oh that 's right . PhD G: Oh , right . PhD E: Yeah . Postdoc A: Now actually , PhD D: That 'll throw them , Postdoc A: we 're  Are we handling  ? PhD D: huh ? Professor F: Uh , maybe we should have you record A , B , C for those or something . PhD D: Yeah .  Huh ! Maybe . And she said it wasn't gonna  the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem cuz they can actually make a template , uh , that has beep , number , beep . So for them it 'll be very quick PhD E: OK . PhD D: to  to put those in there  when they 're transcribing . Professor F: Yeah . PhD D: So , um , we  We 're gonna send them one more sample meeting , uh , and Thilo has run his segmentation . Adam 's gonna generate the chunked file . And then , um , I 'll give it to Brian and they can try that out . And when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription . Professor F: OK . Do w do  what  Do you have any idea of the turn - around on  on those steps you just said ? PhD G: Great . PhD D: Uh . Our s our  On our side ? Professor F: Uh . PhD D: or including IBM 's ? Professor F: Including IBM 's . PhD D: Well , I don't know . The last one seemed like it took a couple of weeks . Um , maybe even three . Professor F: OK . PhD D: Uh , that 's just the I B M side . Our side is quick . I mean , I  I don't know . How long does your  ? PhD E: It should @ @ be finished today or something . Yeah . Professor F: Well , I meant the overall thing . PhD D: Yeah . Professor F: e e u u  The reason I 'm asking is because , uh , Jane and I have just been talking , and she 's just been doing .  Uh , e a , you know , further hiring of transcribers . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor F: And so we don't sort of really know exactly what they 'll be doing , how long they 'll be doing it , and so forth , because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working . PhD D: Right . Professor F: And , uh , so it 'd be  It 'd be good to sort of get that resolved , uh , soon as we could , PhD D: Yeah . I  Yeah , I  I hope @ @  we can get a better estimate from this  one that we send them . Professor F: and then PhD D: So . Um . Professor F: Mm - hmm . PhD D: I  I don't know yet how long that 'll take . Professor F: Yeah . Um  I mean in particular I would  I would really hope that when we do this DARPA meeting in July that we sort of have  we 're  we 're into production mode , somehow PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor F: You know , that we  we actually  have a stream going and we know how  how well it does and how  and how it operates . PhD D: Yeah . Professor F: I think that would  that would certainly be a  a very good thing to know . PhD D: Right . Right . Professor F: OK . Uh . Maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing , maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions . Postdoc A: OK . So , um , we   Uh , the transcribers have continued to work past what I 'm calling \" set one \" , which was the s the set that I 've been , uh  OK , talking about up to this point , but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set . Right now they 're in the process of being edited . Um , the , um  Let 's see , I hired two transcribers today . I 'm thinking of hiring another one , which will  because we 've had a lot of attrition . And that will bring our total to Professor F: They die off after they do this for a while . Postdoc A: Yeah . Well , you know , it 's  it 's various things . PhD D: Burn - out . Professor F: Yeah . Postdoc A: So , one of them had a baby . Um , you know , one of them really w wasn't planning PhD C: Oh , that was an unfor unforeseen side effect of Postdoc A: Eh , one of them , um , had never planned to work past January . I mean , it 's th all these various things , cuz we , you know , we presented it as possibly a month project back in January and  and  and  and  Um , so it makes sense . Uh , through attrition we  we 've  we 're down to  to two , but they 're really solid . We 're really lucky the two that we kept . And , um  Well , I don't mean  I don't mean anything against the others .  What I mean is we 've got a good cause  a good core . No . We had a good core PhD G: Well , they won't hear this since they 're going . They won't be transcribing this meeting . Postdoc A: Yeah , but still . I mean , I d it 's just a matter of we  w we 're  we 've got , uh , Professor F: No backs . Postdoc A: two of the ones who  who , um , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a  a lot of hours , which is wonderful , and excellent work . And so , then , in addition , um , I hired two more today and I 'm planning to h hire a third one with this  within this coming week , but   but the plan is  just as , uh , Morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the  on the leaner side , you know , rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now , Professor F: Mm - hmm . Postdoc A: because if the IBM thing comes through really quickly , then , um , we wouldn't wanna have to , uh , you know , lay people off and stuff . So . And this way it 'll  I mean , I got really a lot of response for  for my notice and I think I could hire additional people if I  wish to . Professor F: Yeah . An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event  and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way  in the unlikely event that we actually find  that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because , you know , there 's , you know ,  all the stuff that  that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're  and they 're faster  the  the pipeline is faster than   uh , than the generation , um , eh , i in  in the day  e event that that day actually dawns , uh , I  I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do . Postdoc A: Oh , yes . Professor F: So I  I think  that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we  if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later . I mean , we also just couldn't sustain that forever . But  but , um  for all sorts of reasons  but if we hire f you know , f we have five on staff  five or six on staff at any given time , then  it 's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way . Postdoc A: Good . OK . Professor F: Good . PhD G: It 'd be great , too , if , um , we can  we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand  to experiment with , um   you know , to have a ground truth for this segmentation work , which  I guess you have some already that was really helpful , and we could probably use more . PhD E: Mmm , yeah . That was a thing I  I planned working on , is , uh , to use the  the transcriptions which are done by now , and to  to use them as , uh PhD G: Oh . Oh , the new ones PhD E: Yeah . PhD G: with the tighter boundaries . Yeah . PhD E: Yeah . And to use them for  for training a  or for  fo whatever . Yeah . To  to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them , and  Yeah , but that  that 's a thing w was  w what I 'm just looking into . PhD G: OK . Postdoc A: The  the  the pre - segmentations are so much  are s so extremely helpful . Now there was , uh , I g guess  So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation  f for just very few days you were away . But it happened to be during that time I needed one , PhD E: Yeah . Postdoc A: so I   so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and , um , they , um  you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available . And he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um  Um . So they really appreciate it . But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while . You know , once in a while there 's something like , PhD E: Yeah , sure . Postdoc A: um , and e Actually you talked to them . Didn't you ? Did you ? Have you  ?"}

Postdoc A: And  and  and she was  And so , I asked her  I mean , They 're very perceptive . I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers . I haven't done it yet , but I wanna do that and she 's out of town , um , for a couple of weeks , but I wanna do that when she returns . Um , cuz she was saying , you know , in a  in a span of very short period  we asked  It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these  these  these things , and she was saying the short utterances , uh , the , um PhD G: Hmm . PhD E: Mmm . Yeah . Postdoc A: you know , I mean , you 're  You 're aware of this . But  but actually i it 's so correct for so much of the time , that it 's an enormous time saver PhD E: Yeah . Postdoc A: and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries . So . PhD G: That 's great . Postdoc A: Um . Yeah . I think it 'd be interesting to combine these . PhD E: Yeah . PhD G: Is there actually a record of where they change ? I mean , you can compare , do a diff on the  just so that we  knew Postdoc A: You could do it . It 's  it 's complicated in that  um ,  hhh , i hhh , i PhD E: Yeah . Actually , when  when they create new  yeah , new segments or something , it will be , uh , not that easy but  hmm . I think  one could do that . PhD G: I mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks PhD E: Yeah . PhD G: just so that if we run it we know whether we 're  which ones were cheating PhD E: Yeah . Yeah . That would be great , yeah , to know that . PhD G: and Postdoc A: There is a  there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version . PhD G: which one would be good . PhD E: Yeah . Postdoc A: So it 's not a pure  it 's not a pure condition . Wha - what you 'd really like is that they started with pre - segmented and were pre - segmented all the way through . PhD G: Mm - hmm . Postdoc A: And , um  @ @   I , uh  the  it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones . But , it will be possible in the future PhD E: Yeah . Postdoc A: because we  we 're , um . PhD E: It would . PhD G: Mmm , that 's great . PhD E: Yeah . PhD G: Yeah . As long as we have a record , I guess , of the original  automatic one , we can always find out how well  we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries . PhD E: Yeah . Yeah . PhD G: Um . PhD E: Yeah . PhD G: You know , a completely non - cheating version . PhD E: Yeah . PhD G: Also if you need someone to record this meeting , I mean , I 'm happy to  for the transcribers  I could do it , or Chuck or Adam . Postdoc A: Thank you . Professor F: OK . So , uh , u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info ? PhD D: Yeah . So , um , uh , Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the  directory structure for all of the meeting Professor F: Did you record it ? PhD D: No . For all the Meeting Recorder data . We should have . Um . And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there . And then , Jane also s prepared a  um , started getting all of the  the meetings organized , so she prepared a   a spreadsheet , which I spent the last couple of days adding to . So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have been putting it into , uh , a spreadsheet  with start time , the date , the old meeting name , the new meeting name , the number of speakers , the duration of the meeting , comments , you know , what its transcription status is , all that kind of stuff . And so , the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page so we can keep people updated about what 's going on . PhD G: Oh , great . PhD D: Um , I 've gotta get some more information from Jane cuz I have some  some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in , but  so far , um ,  as of Monday , the fourteenth , um , we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected . And , um  Uh , some other interesting things , average number of speakers per meeting is six . Um , and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far , but I 've got a bunch of  uh , that 's what I have to talk to Jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have  have been completed and so forth . But , um ,  this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the  the web site and people can  be informed of the status of various different ones . And  it 'll also list , uh , like under the status , if it 's at IBM or if it 's at ICSI , uh , or if it 's completed or which ones we 're excluding and  and there 's a place for comments , so we can ,  um , say why we 're excluding things and so forth . So . Professor F: Now would the ones that , um , are already transcribed  we h we have enough there that c you know , we 've already done some studies and so forth and  um , shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of  of having the , um , uh , participants approve it , uh , for  approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ? Postdoc A: Um , interesting idea . In principle , I  I would say yes , although I still am doing some  the final - pass editing , trying to convert it over to the master file as the  being the channelized version and it 's  Yeah , it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes  and I have to stop . Cleaning up the things like the , uh , uh , places where the transcriber was uncertain , and  and doing spot - checking here and there . So , um , uh , I guess it would make sense to wait until th that 's done , um , but  but Professor F: Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of  as  as I did with the , uh , uh  the  the pipeline . Postdoc A: Yeah . Professor F: Um , we are gonna have this DARPA  meeting in the middle of July , Postdoc A: Yes . Professor F: and I think it w it 'd be  given that we 've been  we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . Um . Postdoc A: It 'll certainly be done by then . Yeah . Professor F: Right . So we can s we  we wanna be able to say \" here is a subset that is available right now \" Postdoc A: Mm - hmm . That 's right . Professor F: and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth . Postdoc A: That 's right . Professor F: So . Postdoc A: Yeah . That 's right . So that Professor F: OK ? Postdoc A: OK . Professor F: So , by  before July . PhD C: And they don't have to approve , you know , th an edited version , they can just give their approval to whatever version Postdoc A: Well , maybe Professor F: Well , in principle , yes . But , I mean , i if  if  if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we PhD C: Bu Yeah . But th I mean , the editing will continue . Presumably if  if s errors are found , they will be fixed , but they won't change the  the content of the meetings . PhD D: Content , really . Postdoc A: Well , see , this is the  this is the issue . Subtleties . PhD C: So . PhD G: Well , i if Jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ? Postdoc A: The other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @  could 've been transcribed in the other way . Professor F: Yeah . PhD G: Thing Postdoc A: And no and they wouldn't have  been slanderous if it had been this other word . You know ? Professor F: I it  you know , there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . Right ? And you don't  you  there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody \" do you approve this , uh , you know  this document now ? \" So  So I think what it is is that the  the  the  the thing that they sign  I  I haven't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says \" OK , from now on  you know , now that I 've read this , you can use  do anything you want with these data . \" Postdoc A: Mm - hmm . Professor F: And , uh  But , i I think we wanna  So , assuming that it 's in that kind of wording , which I don't remember ,  um , I think i we just wanna have enough confidence ourselves that it 's so close to the final form it 's gonna be in , a year from now that they 're Postdoc A: Mm - hmm . I agree . Mmm . I totally agree . It 's just , uh , a question of ,  uh , if  if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous ,  then it seems like it 's  it 's  i it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re - listening to the meeting . Professor F: Uh . Postdoc A: Because it becomes , eh , in a way a  a f uh , a legal document i if they 've agreed to that . Professor F: Well , I forget how we end Right . I forget how we ended up on this , but I remember my taking the position  of not making it so  so easy for everybody to observe everything and Adam was taking the position of  of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio . And I don't remember who won , Adam or me , but Postdoc A: Well ,  if it 's only the transcript , though  I mean , th this  this is my point , that  that Professor F: uh , the  Uh , that that 's why I 'm bringing this up again , because I can't remember how we ended up . Postdoc A: then it becomes Professor F: That it was the transcrip He wanted to do a web interface that would make it Postdoc A: Well , if it 's just the audio  Well . Professor F: that would give you access to the transcript and the audio . That 's what Adam wanted . Postdoc A: Mm - hmm . Professor F: And I don't remember how we ended up . PhD G: I mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . And , I mean , I would say \" no \" . Like , I don't wanna know , but some people might be really  interested and then y In other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that . Professor F: You decided you were whispering Satanic incantations under your breath when you were PhD G: Well ,  I don't know what happened to the small heads thing , but I j  Um , I 'm just saying that , like , you know , you can sort of say that any things that are deemed Professor F: They disappeared from view . PhD G: Anyway . I mean , I agree that at some point people  probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes and then they could be asked for their consent , I guess , if  if those change .

But , I mean , i if  if  if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we PhD C: Bu Yeah . But th I mean , the editing will continue .

Subtleties . PhD C: So . PhD G: Well , i if Jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ? Postdoc A: The other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @  could 've been transcribed in the other way . Professor F: Yeah . PhD G: Thing Postdoc A: And no and they wouldn't have  been slanderous if it had been this other word . You know ? Professor F: I it  you know , there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . Right ? And you don't  you  there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody \" do you approve this , uh , you know  this document now ? \" So  So I think what it is is that the  the  the  the thing that they sign  I  I haven't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says \" OK , from now on  you know , now that I 've read this , you can use  do anything you want with these data . \" Postdoc A: Mm - hmm . Professor F: And , uh  But , i I think we wanna  So , assuming that it 's in that kind of wording , which I don't remember ,  um , I think i we just wanna have enough confidence ourselves that it 's so close to the final form it 's gonna be in , a year from now that they 're Postdoc A: Mm - hmm . I agree . Mmm . I totally agree . It 's just , uh , a question of ,  uh , if  if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous ,  then it seems like it 's  it 's  i it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re - listening to the meeting . Professor F: Uh . Postdoc A: Because it becomes , eh , in a way a  a f uh , a legal document i if they 've agreed to that . Professor F: Well , I forget how we end Right . I forget how we ended up on this , but I remember my taking the position  of not making it so  so easy for everybody to observe everything and Adam was taking the position of  of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio . And I don't remember who won , Adam or me , but Postdoc A: Well ,  if it 's only the transcript , though  I mean , th this  this is my point , that  that Professor F: uh , the  Uh , that that 's why I 'm bringing this up again , because I can't remember how we ended up . Postdoc A: then it becomes Professor F: That it was the transcrip He wanted to do a web interface that would make it Postdoc A: Well , if it 's just the audio  Well . Professor F: that would give you access to the transcript and the audio . That 's what Adam wanted . Postdoc A: Mm - hmm . Professor F: And I don't remember how we ended up . PhD G: I mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . And , I mean , I would say \" no \" . Like , I don't wanna know , but some people might be really  interested and then y In other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that . Professor F: You decided you were whispering Satanic incantations under your breath when you were PhD G: Well ,  I don't know what happened to the small heads thing , but I j  Um , I 'm just saying that , like , you know , you can sort of say that any things that are deemed Professor F: They disappeared from view . PhD G: Anyway . I mean , I agree that at some point people  probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes and then they could be asked for their consent , I guess , if  if those change . Cuz assumi  assuming we  we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign anyway . PhD C: Tha That 's  How about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts ? PhD G: Oh , my God . Postdoc A: That would be simpler , Professor F: Uh . Postdoc A: if we could count on them listening . PhD G: But no one will listen to the hours and hours of PhD D: Talk . PhD C: Well , that 's O K . Grad B: That 's PhD C: We just have to give them a chance to listen to it , and if they don't , that 's their problem . Grad B: hmm , hmm . PhD G: You  you d That 's like Postdoc A: Unfortunately , uh , in  in the sign thing that they signed , it says \" transcripts \" . PhD C: No , I 'm serious . Postdoc A: \" You 'll be  you 'll be provided the transcripts when they 're available . \" PhD C: Really ? Grad B: Mmm . PhD C: Mmm . Professor F: Yeah . PhD E: Yeah . PhD G: I I  I think Postdoc A: Yeah . PhD G: that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings . Postdoc A: Yeah . Professor F: W anyway , haven't we  we 've gone down this path a number of times . I know this can lead to extended conversations and  and not really get anywhere , so let  let me just suggest that   uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's July . Postdoc A: Yes . Professor F: OK . So  so that in July we can tell people  \" yes , we have this and you can use it \" . Postdoc A: Yes . It 's done , ready , available . Good . Professor F: Uh . So , let 's see . What else we got ? Uh . Don did  did a report about his project in class and , uh  an oral and written  written version . PhD G: Well . Professor F: So that was stuff he was doing with you . Yeah . PhD G: I mean , it 's  I guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount  We have eight meetings there because we couldn't use the non - native  all non - native meetings and  it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at because the  prosodic features are  very noisy and so you  you need a lot of data in order to model them . Um , so we 're starting to see some patterns and we 're hoping that maybe with ,  I don't know , double or triple the data  with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results . But we did find that some of the features that , I gue Jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the  distance of , um ,  boundaries from peaks in the utterance and  some  local , um , range  pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers , which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words . Um , so these are based on forced alignment . Word features like , um , word frequency and whether or not something 's a backchannel and so forth . So , we 're starting to see , I think , some interesting patterns . Professor F: So the dominant features , including everything , were those  those quasi - cheating things . Right ? Where these are Grad B: Sometimes not . PhD G: I think it depends what you 're looking at , a actually . Grad B: Yeah . Sometimes  positions in sentences obviously , or in spurts , was helpful . I don't know if that 's cheating , too . PhD G: Right . Um , PhD C: Spurts wouldn't be . Right ? PhD G: spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words , Grad B: Right . PhD G: but roughly speaking , the recognized words are gonna give you a similar type of position . Grad B: Right . Would they give you the same number of words , though ? Professor F: Right . PhD G: It 's either early or late . PhD C: No PhD G: Not exactly , but i Grad B: But ra somewhat ? Professor F: On the average . PhD G: Y yeah it should be . Well , we don't know and actually that 's one of the things we 're interested in doing , is a sort of Professor F: Uh - huh . PhD C: Have you tried using just time , as opposed to number of words ? PhD G: So . Grad B: I think ti uh  Just p time position , like when the word starts ? PhD C: Yeah . Grad B: I don't know if that was in the PhD C: Well , no , I mean t time  time position relative to the beginning of the spurt . PhD G: Eh  You know , uh Grad B: Start . PhD G: Yeah , Grad B: Yeah . There 's all these things to do . PhD G: uh , we didn't try it , but it 's s Grad B: Like , there 's a lot of different features you could just pull out . PhD C: Yeah . I mean that wouldn't be cheating because you can detect pause  pretty well within the time . Grad B: Right . PhD G: Right . Professor F: How about time position normalized by speak PhD G: And it depends on speaking rate Professor F: Yeah .  Yeah . PhD G: speaking rate . Yeah . Grad B: Yeah . PhD G: Yeah . That 's actually why I didn't use it at first . Professor F: Yeah . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD G: But we  one of the interesting things was I guess you reported on some te punctuation type Grad B: Yeah . PhD G: finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries , and then I had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt , so where  you know , if I 'm talking now and someone  and  and Andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gonna choose a certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based . And there the prosodic features actually showed up and a neat thing  even though the word features were available . And a neat thing there too is I tried some   putting the speaker  So , I gave everybody  a short version of their name . So the real names are in there , which we couldn't use . Uh , we should use I Ds or something . And those don't show up . So that means that overall , um , it wasn't just modeling Morgan , or it wasn't just modeling a single person , Professor F: Mm - hmm . PhD G: um , but was sort of trying to ,  uh , get a general idea  the model  the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers , even though there are huge speaker effects . So . The  but the main limitation now is I  because we 're only looking at things that happen every  ten words or every twenty words , we need more  more data and more data per speaker . So . It 'd also be interesting to look at the EDU meetings because we did include meeting type as a feature , so whether you were in a r Meeting Recorder meeting or a Robustness meeting did matter  to  interrupts because there are just fewer interrupts in the Robustness meetings . Grad B: Mm - hmm . PhD G: And so the classifier learns more about Morgan than it does about sort of the average person , Professor F: Mm - hmm . PhD G: which is  not bad . It 'd probably do better than   Um , but it wasn't generalizing . Professor F: Yeah . PhD G: So it 's  And I think Don , um  Well , we have a long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer , where we can  And he 'll be able to report on more things  in the future . But it was great that we could at least go from the   you know , Jane 's transcripts and the ,  uh , recognizer output and get it  to this point . And I think it 's something Mari can probably use in her preliminary report  like , \" yeah , we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers and we 're just  reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that  some features , both word and pro prosodic , work . \" The other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in Switchboard . And I think that really is from the close - talking mikes , cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than  than the Switchboard telephone bandwidth . PhD C: W wh wh wh Better in what sense ? PhD G: Um . Well , first of all , the pitch tracks are m have less , um , halvings and doublings than  than Switchboard and there 's a lot less dropout , so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring  are completely devoid of pitch information , Professor F: Mm - hmm . PhD G: in other words the pitch tracker just didn't get a high enough probability of voicing for words  for  for , you know , five word Professor F: Hmm . PhD G: there are much fewer than in Switchboard . So the missing   We had a big missing data problem in Switchboard and , so the features weren't as reliable cuz they were often just not available . PhD D: Could it have to do with the  the lower frequency cut - off on the Switchboard ? PhD G: So that 's actually good . Ma - maybe . I mean , the tele we had telephone bandwidth for Switchboard and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that I think may also affect it . PhD D: Hmm . PhD G: So we 're just getting better signals in  in this data . Which is nice . So ."}

PhD E: Y PhD G: to  to try to get a non - cheating version of how all this would work . PhD E: Yeah . Sure . Yeah . Professor F: Has  has , uh  ? We just  I think , just talked about this the other day , but h has  has anybody had a chance to try changing , uh , insertion penalty sort of things with the  with the , uh   uh , using the tandem system input for the  ? PhD C: Oh , yeah . I tried that . It didn't , um , help dramatically . The PhD D: Were they out of balance ? I didn't  I didn't notice . PhD C: There were a little  the relative number of  I think there were a higher number of deletions , actually . Professor F: Oh . PhD C: So , you , uh  So , actually it  it preferred to have a positive  er , negative insertion penalty , PhD G: Deletions ? PhD C: which means  that , um Professor F: Uh - huh . PhD C: But , you know , it didn't change  th the  by adjusting that  the , um Professor F: OK . PhD C: Yeah . The error changed by probably one percent or so . But , you know , given that that word error rate is so high , that 's not a Professor F: OK . So that  So that 's  So that 's not the problem . PhD C: That 's not the problem . No . Professor F: Yeah . PhD C: But , uh , we s just , um , uh  you know , Chuck and I talked and the  @ @  next thing to do is probably to tune the  um , the size of the Gaussian system , um , @ @  to  to this  to this feature vector , which we haven't done at all . We just used the same  configuration as we used for the   for the standard system . Professor F: Hmm . PhD C: And ,  for instance , uh , Dan  @ @  Dan just sent me a message saying that CMU used , um ,  something like ten Gaussians per cluster  You know , each  each mixture has ten  Gaussians PhD D: Mm - hmm . Hmm . We 're using sixty - four , PhD C: and  and we 're using sixty - four , PhD D: right ? PhD C: so that 's  obviously a big difference PhD D: Yeah . PhD C: and it might be way off and give very poorly trained , uh , you know , Gaussians that way , Professor F: Hmm . PhD C: uh , an and poorly trained mixture weights . So  so , we have  The turn - around time on the training when we train only the  a male system with , uh , you know , our small training set , is  less than twenty - four hours , so we can run lots of   uh , basically just brute force , try a whole bunch of different um , settings . Professor F: OK . PhD C: And , uh , with the new machines it 'll be even better . So . Professor F: Yeah . We get twelve of those , PhD C: Yeah . Professor F: huh ? PhD C: But the PLP features work  um , uh , you know , continue to improve the , Professor F: OK . PhD C: um  As I said before , the  uh using Dan 's , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization option works very well . So , um , @ @  I ran one experiment where we 're just  did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data , Professor F: Mm - hmm . PhD C: so I didn't bother to retrain  the models at all , and it improved by one percent , which is about what we get with   uh , with , you know , just @ @  actually doing both training and test normalization , um , with , um ,  the , uh   uh , with the standard system . So , in a few hours we 'll have the numbers for the  for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization and  So , that might even improve it further . Professor F: Great . PhD C: So , it looks like the P L - fea P features  do very well now with  after having figured out all these little tricks to  to get it to work . Professor F: Yeah . PhD C: So . Professor F: Good . PhD G: Wait . So you mean you improve one percent over a system that doesn't have any V T L in it already ? PhD C: Exactly . Yeah . PhD G: OK . Professor F: Yeah . OK . So then  then we 'll have our baseline to  to compare the currently hideous , uh , uh , new thing with . PhD C: Right . a Right . And  and what that suggests also is of course that the current Switchboard  MLP isn't trained on very good features . Professor F: But  Yeah . PhD C: Uh , because it was trained on whatever , you know , was used , uh , last time you did Hub - five stuff , which didn't have any of the Professor F: Right . But all of these effects were j like a couple percent . PhD C: Uh . Professor F: Right ? I mean , y the PhD C: Well , but if you add them all up you have , uh , almost five percent difference now . Professor F: Add  all of them . I thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight . PhD C: Yeah . And now we have another percent with the V T Professor F: That 's three point three . PhD C: Um , actually , and it 's ,  um , What 's actually qu interesting is that with  um , well , you m prob maybe another half percent if you do the VTL in training , and then interestingly , if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the , um ,  uh , the N best lists , uh , and optimizing the weights , um , uh than PhD D: Than you do with the standard ? PhD C: Yeah . So Professor F: Yeah . But the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing  putting VTLN in or something is  it was a couple percent . PhD C: Right . Professor F: Right ? It was  it was  there was   there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . So  and  and  let me see if I remember what they were . One of them  was , uh , the change to , uh  because it did it all at once ,  to  uh , from bark scale to mel scale , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: which I really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @  they 're essentially the same scale but the  but  but  but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . PhD G: Yeah . Why did that cha ? PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: So that 's why I wanted to look  I still haven't looked at it yet . I  I wanna look at exactly where the filters were in the two , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: and it   it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub  one kilohertz band PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other . PhD G: Hmm . Professor F: Um , it could be there 's something more fundamental but it  you know , I  I don't know it yet . And the other  and the other  that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was  what was the other thing ? PhD D: Well , that was combined with the triangular . Right ? Professor F: Yeah . Those  those two were together . PhD D: Yeah . Right . Professor F: We d weren't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing . But then there was a point eight percent which was something else . PhD D: The low - frequency cut - off . Professor F: Do you remember the  ? Oh , yeah . So that was  that was , uh  that one I can claim credit for , uh , i in terms of screwing it up in the first place . So that someone e until someone else fixed it , which is that , um , I never put  when I u We had some problems before with offsets . This inf this went back to , uh , I think Wall Street Journal . PhD C: Hmm . Professor F: So we  we had , uh  ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data  in those data and  and  and nobody happened to mention it to us , PhD C: Hmm . Professor F: and we were getting these , like , really terrible results , like two , three times the error everybody else was getting . And then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned \" uh , well , I guess , you know , of course you 're taking care of the offsets . \" I said \" what offsets ? \" PhD C: Mm - hmm .

But the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing  putting VTLN in or something is  it was a couple percent . PhD C: Right . Professor F: Right ? It was  it was  there was   there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . So  and  and  let me see if I remember what they were . One of them  was , uh , the change to , uh  because it did it all at once ,  to  uh , from bark scale to mel scale , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: which I really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @  they 're essentially the same scale but the  but  but  but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . PhD G: Yeah . Why did that cha ? PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: So that 's why I wanted to look  I still haven't looked at it yet . I  I wanna look at exactly where the filters were in the two , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: and it   it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub  one kilohertz band PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other . PhD G: Hmm . Professor F: Um , it could be there 's something more fundamental but it  you know , I  I don't know it yet . And the other  and the other  that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was  what was the other thing ? PhD D: Well , that was combined with the triangular . Right ? Professor F: Yeah . Those  those two were together . PhD D: Yeah . Right . Professor F: We d weren't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing . But then there was a point eight percent which was something else . PhD D: The low - frequency cut - off . Professor F: Do you remember the  ? Oh , yeah . So that was  that was , uh  that one I can claim credit for , uh , i in terms of screwing it up in the first place . So that someone e until someone else fixed it , which is that , um , I never put  when I u We had some problems before with offsets . This inf this went back to , uh , I think Wall Street Journal . PhD C: Hmm . Professor F: So we  we had , uh  ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data  in those data and  and  and nobody happened to mention it to us , PhD C: Hmm . Professor F: and we were getting these , like , really terrible results , like two , three times the error everybody else was getting . And then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned \" uh , well , I guess , you know , of course you 're taking care of the offsets . \" I said \" what offsets ? \" PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: And at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen and then when we just put it on the screen  and wroop ! PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: there 's this big DC offset . So , um , in PLP PhD G: There was a  like a hum or some or  when they recorded it ? Professor F: No . It 's just , it  it 's  it 's not at all uncommon for  for recorded electronics to have different , um , DC offsets . PhD G: Or just  ? Huh . Professor F: It 's  it 's , you know , no big deal . It 's  you know , you could have ten , twenty , maybe thirty millivolts , whatever , and it 's consistently in there . The thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency , so that it 's irrelevant . Uh , but with P L P , we didn't actually have that . We had  we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a  a , uh , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency , PhD G: Hmm . Professor F: like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does . We had something more fancy . It was later on it didn't have that . So at that point I reali \" oh sh we better have a  have a high - pass filter \" just , you know   just take care of the problem . So I put in a high - pass filter at , uh , I think ninety  ninety hertz or so  uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate . And I never put anything in to adjust it for different  different sampling rates . And so  well , so , you know , the code doesn't know anything about that and so this is all at eight kilohertz and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at   instead of at ninety . PhD C: Hmm . Professor F: So , um , I don't know if Dan fixed it or  or , uh , what he PhD C: Well , he made it a parameter . Professor F: He made it a parameter . So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it and then  and then it 's taking care of sampling rate , which is great . PhD D: What  what is the parameter ? Professor F: He had a PhD D: Is it , uh , just the f lower cut - off that you want ? PhD C: It 's called , uh ,  H - HPF . Professor F: H  Yeah . Does HPF on  on his feat feature . PhD C: u And  but HPF , you know , when you put a number after it , uses that as the hertz value of the cut - off . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Oh , OK . Professor F: Yeah . PhD C: So . Professor F: I mean , frankly , we never did that with the RASTA filter either , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing , which is  another old  old bug of mine . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: But , um  Um . So that  that was the problem there was th we  we  we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: and it just wasn't doing it , so now it is . So ,  that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of a percent . It  still wasn't a big deal . PhD C: OK . Well , but , um  Well , uh , again , after completing the  current experiments , we 'll   we can add up all the uh differences Professor F: Oh , yeah . PhD C: and   and  an Professor F: But  but , I guess my  my point was that  that , um , the hybrid system thing that we did was , uh , primitive in many ways . PhD C: Y Right . Professor F: And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have a  a  a competitive system . But I think not that much of it is due to the front - end per se . I think maybe a couple percent of it is , as far as I can see from this . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: Uh , unless you call  well , if you call VTL the front - en front - end , that 's , uh , a little more . But that 's sort of more both , kind of . PhD D: One experiment we should  we 'll probably need to do though when  um , at some point , is , since we 're using that same  the net that was trained on PLP without all these things in it , for the tandem system , we may wanna go back and retrain , Professor F: Right ? But . PhD C: Well , that 's what I meant , in fact . Yeah . PhD D: yeah , yeah , for the tandem . You know , so we can see if it  what effect it has on the tandem processing . PhD C: So  so , the thing is  is do we expect  ? Professor F: Mm - hmm . PhD C: eh At this point I 'm as I mean , you know  e I 'm wondering is it  Can we expect , uh , a tandem system to do better than a properly trained  you know , a Gaussian system trained directly on the features with , you know , the right ch choice of  parameters ? Professor F: Well , that 's what we 're seeing in other areas . Yes . Right ? So , it 's  so , um , um PhD D: So , we  But  but we may not . I mean , if it doesn't perform as well , we may not know why . Right ? Cuz we need to do the exact experiment . PhD C: Right . Professor F: I mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative . So . Um . Now the thing is , in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much and  and part of what I view as the real power of it is that it  gives you a transformational capability  for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do , not just th the standard front - end , but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: and allows you to feed them to the other system with this  through this funnel . Um , so I think  I think that 's the real power of it . I wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements . Um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor F: If it 's , you know , like way way worse then , you know PhD C: Right . PhD D: So , Morgan , an another thing that Andreas and I were talking about was , so @ @  in the first experiment that he did  we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either MFCC or PLP . Professor F: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD D: But one thing we could do is Professor F: Let  let me  let me just ask you something . When you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity  outputs PhD D: Yeah . Through the regular tandem outputs . Professor F: and they 're  and  through the KLT . PhD D: Through the KLT . All that kinda stuff . Professor F: OK . And so  so then you u Do you use all fifty - six of the KLT PhD D: That 's what we did . Professor F: or  ? PhD D: Right ? So one thing we were wondering is , if we did principal components and , say , took out just thirteen , and then did deltas and double - deltas on that Professor F: OK . Yes . PhD D: so we treated the th first thirteen as though they were  standard features . Professor F: Yes . Yeah . PhD D: I mean , did Dan do experiments like that to  ? Professor F: Uh . Talk with Stephane . He did some things like that . It was either him or Carmen . I forget . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Mmm . Professor F: I mean these were all different databases and different  you know , in HTK and all that , PhD D: Yeah . Professor F: so i it  it may not apply . But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse . PhD D: Hmm . Professor F: But , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components . PhD D: Cuz in a sense , the net 's already got quite a bit of context in those features , Professor F: Yeah . PhD D: so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more . Professor F: Which could be good or not . PhD D: Yeah ."}

Um , I can say about  just q just quickly to get through it , that Dave and I submitted this ASRU . PhD A: This is for ASRU . Professor B: Yeah . So . Um . Yeah , it 's  it 's interesting . I mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well .

Um  And actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the Aurora stuff too . Um , I know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the Mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at  at , uh  at OGI . Um , but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using ,  the  the Aurora HTK system baseline system  and the system that we were  the  the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the SRI system , was that the SRI system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass . And the , uh , Aurora HTK , it was like twenty . PhD D: Yep . S sixty - four . Professor B: Uh . PhD D: S sixty - four . Professor B: Sixty - four ? Uh . PhD D: Yeah , if you 're using the baseline . Professor B: Is that the ba band center ? PhD D: No , the edge . Professor B: The edge is really , uh , sixty - four ? PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: For some reason , uh , Dave thought it was twenty , PhD D: So the , uh , center would be somewhere around like hundred Professor B: but . PhD D: and  hundred and  hundred  hundred and  maybe  it 's like  fi hundred hertz . Professor B: But do you know , for instance , h how far down it would be at twenty hertz ? What the  how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz , let 's say ? PhD D: At twenty hertz . Professor B: Yeah , any idea what the curve looks like ? PhD D: Twenty hertz frequency  Oh , it 's  it 's zero at twenty hertz , right ? The filter ? PhD C: Yea - actually , the left edge of the first filter is at sixty - four . PhD D: Sixt - s sixty - four . PhD C: So PhD D: So anything less than sixty - four is zero . PhD C: Mmm . Professor B: It 's actually set to zero ? What kind of filter is that ? PhD C: Yeah . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: Is this  oh , from the  from PhD C: It  This is the filter bank in the frequency domain that starts at sixty - four . Professor B: Oh , so you , uh  so you really set it to zero , the FFT ? PhD D: Yeah , PhD C: Yeah . PhD D: yeah . So it 's  it 's a weight on the ball spectrum . Triangular weighting . Professor B: Right . OK . Um  OK . So that 's  that 's a little different than Dave thought , I think . But  but , um , still , it 's possible that we 're getting in some more noise . So I wonder , is it  @ @ Was there  their experimentation with , uh , say , throwing away that filter or something ? And , uh PhD D: Uh , throwing away the first ? Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: Um , yeah , we  we 've tried including the full  full bank . Right ? From zero to four K . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: And that 's always worse than using sixty - four hertz . Professor B: Right , but the question is , whether sixty - four hertz is  is , uh , too , uh , low . PhD D: Yeah , I mean , make it a hundred or so ? Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: I t I think I 've tried a hundred and it was more or less the same , or slightly worse . Professor B: On what test set ? PhD D: On the same , uh , SpeechDat - Car , Aurora . Professor B: Um , it was on the SpeechDat - Car . PhD D: Yeah . So I tried a hundred to four K . Yeah . Professor B: Um , PhD D: So it was Professor B: and on  and on the , um , um ,  TI - digits also ? PhD D: No , no , no . I think I just tried it on SpeechDat - Car . Professor B: Mmm . That 'd be something to look at sometime because what , um , eh , he was looking at was performance in this room . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Would that be more like  Well , you 'd think that 'd be more like SpeechDat - Car , I guess , in terms of the noise . The SpeechDat - Car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it . And  and TI - digits maybe is not so much as PhD D: Yeah . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: Mm - hmm . OK . Well , maybe it 's not a big deal . But , um  Anyway , that was just something we wondered about . But , um , uh , certainly a lot of the noise , uh , is , uh , below a hundred hertz . Uh , the signal - to - noise ratio , you know , looks a fair amount better if you  if you high - pass filter it from this room . PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: But , um  but it 's still pretty noisy . Even  even for a hundred hertz up , it 's  it 's still fairly noisy . The signal - to - noise ratio is  is  is actually still pretty bad . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: Hmm . Professor B: So , um , I mean , the main  the  the PhD A: So that 's on th that 's on the f the far field ones though , right ? Yeah . Professor B: Yeah , that 's on the far field . Yeah , the near field 's pretty good . PhD A: So wha what is , uh  what 's causing that ? Professor B: Well , we got a  a video projector in here , uh , and , uh  which we keep on during every  every session we record , PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: which , you know , I  I  w we were aware of PhD A: Uh - huh . Professor B: but  but we thought it wasn't a bad thing . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: I mean , that 's a nice noise source . Uh , and there 's also the , uh  uh , air conditioning . PhD A: Hmm . Professor B: Which , uh , you know , is a pretty low frequency kind of thing . PhD A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: But  but , uh  So , those are  those are major components , I think , PhD A: I see . Professor B: uh , for the stationary kind of stuff . PhD A: Mmm . Professor B: Um , but , um , it , uh  I guess , I  maybe I said this last week too but it  it  it really became apparent to us that we need to  to take account of noise . And , uh , so I think when  when he gets done with his prelim study I think  one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , uh  uh , noise , uh , processing stuff and  and , uh  uh , synthesize some speech from it . PhD A: When are his prelims ? Professor B: And then  Um , I think in about , um , a little less than two weeks . PhD A: Oh . Wow . Professor B: Yeah . Yeah . So . Uh , it might even be sooner . Uh , let 's see , this is the sixteenth , seventeenth ? Yeah , I don't know if he 's before  It might even be in a week . PhD A: So , I Professor B: A week , PhD A: Huh . I  I guessed that they were gonna do it some time during the semester Professor B: week and a half . PhD A: but they 'll do it any time , huh ? Professor B: They seem to be  Well , the semester actually is starting up . PhD A: Is it already ? Professor B: Yeah , the semester 's late  late August they start here . PhD A: Yikes . Professor B: So they do it right at the beginning of the semester . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: Yeah . So , uh  Yep . I mean , that  that was sort of one  I mean , the overall results seemed to be first place in  in  in the case of either , um , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set . Uh , either way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot . And  But if you had a  a really big training set , a recognizer , uh , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set  I thought that  One thing with the HTK is that is has the  as we 're using  the configuration we 're using is w s is  being bound by the terms of Aurora , we have all those parameters just set as they are . So even if we had a hundred times as much data , we wouldn't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many Gaussians or anything . So , um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of  of  of big chunks of data . Uh , whereas the other one does sort of expand as you have more training data . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Mmm , yeah . Professor B: It does it automatically , actually . And so , um , uh , that one really benefited from the larger set . And it was also a diverse set with different noises and so forth . Uh , so , um , that , uh  that seemed to be  So , if you have that  that better recognizer that can  that can build up more parameters , and if you , um , have the natural room , which in this case has a p a pretty bad signal - to - noise ratio , then in that case , um , the right thing to do is just do  u use speaker adaptation . And  and not bother with  with this acoustic , uh , processing . But I think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise - processing as well as , uh , the convolutional kind of things we were doing . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So . That 's sort of what we found . PhD D: Hmm . PhD A: I , um   uh , started working on the uh  Mississippi State recognizer . So , I got in touch with Joe and  and , uh , from your email and things like that . PhD D: Oh , OK . PhD A: And , uh , they added me to the list  uh , the mailing list . PhD D: OK , great . PhD A: And he gave me all of the pointers and everything that I needed . And so I downloaded the , um  There were two things , uh , that they had to download . One was the , uh , I guess the software . And another wad  was a , um , sort of like a sample  a sample run . So I downloaded the software and compiled all of that . And it compiled fine . PhD D: Eight . PhD A: No problems . PhD D: Oh , eh , great . PhD A: And , um , I grabbed the sample stuff but I haven't , uh , compiled it . PhD D: That sample was released only yesterday or the day before , right ? PhD A: No  Well , I haven't grabbed that one yet . So there 's two . PhD D: Oh , there is another short sample set PhD A: There was another short one , yeah . PhD D: o o sample . PhD A: And so I haven't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet . PhD D: OK . Oh , OK . F Yeah , OK . PhD A: So . Um , but , the software seemed to compile fine and everything , so . And , um , So . Professor B: Is there any word yet about the issues about , um , adjustments for different feature sets or anything ? PhD A: No , I  I d You asked me to write to him and I think I forgot to ask him about that . Or if I did ask him , he didn't reply . Professor B: Yeah . PhD A: I  I don't remember yet . Uh , I 'll  I 'll d I 'll double check that and ask him again . Professor B: Yeah . Yeah , it 's like that  that could r turn out to be an important issue for us . PhD D: Hmm . Mmm . PhD A: Yeah . Yeah . Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: Cuz they have it PhD A: Maybe I 'll send it to the list . Yeah . PhD D: Cuz they have , uh , already frozen those in i insertion penalties and all those stuff is what  I feel . Because they have this document explaining the recognizer . PhD A: Uh - huh . PhD D: And they have these tables with , uh , various language model weights , insertion penalties . PhD A: OK , I haven't seen that one yet . PhD D: u PhD A: So . PhD D: Uh , it 's th it 's there on that web . PhD A: OK . PhD D: And , uh , on that , I mean , they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those PhD A: And so they 've picked  the values . PhD D: Yeah , I think they pi p PhD A: Oh , OK . PhD D: yeah , they picked the values from PhD A: OK . Professor B: For r w what test set ? PhD D: Uh , p the one that they have reported is a NIST evaluation , Wall Street Journal . Professor B: But that has nothing to do with what we 're testing on , right ? PhD C: Mm - hmm .

PhD D: Oh , there is another short sample set PhD A: There was another short one , yeah . PhD D: o o sample . PhD A: And so I haven't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet . PhD D: OK . Oh , OK . F Yeah , OK . PhD A: So . Um , but , the software seemed to compile fine and everything , so . And , um , So . Professor B: Is there any word yet about the issues about , um , adjustments for different feature sets or anything ? PhD A: No , I  I d You asked me to write to him and I think I forgot to ask him about that . Or if I did ask him , he didn't reply . Professor B: Yeah . PhD A: I  I don't remember yet . Uh , I 'll  I 'll d I 'll double check that and ask him again . Professor B: Yeah . Yeah , it 's like that  that could r turn out to be an important issue for us . PhD D: Hmm . Mmm . PhD A: Yeah . Yeah . Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: Cuz they have it PhD A: Maybe I 'll send it to the list . Yeah . PhD D: Cuz they have , uh , already frozen those in i insertion penalties and all those stuff is what  I feel . Because they have this document explaining the recognizer . PhD A: Uh - huh . PhD D: And they have these tables with , uh , various language model weights , insertion penalties . PhD A: OK , I haven't seen that one yet . PhD D: u PhD A: So . PhD D: Uh , it 's th it 's there on that web . PhD A: OK . PhD D: And , uh , on that , I mean , they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those PhD A: And so they 've picked  the values . PhD D: Yeah , I think they pi p PhD A: Oh , OK . PhD D: yeah , they picked the values from PhD A: OK . Professor B: For r w what test set ? PhD D: Uh , p the one that they have reported is a NIST evaluation , Wall Street Journal . Professor B: But that has nothing to do with what we 're testing on , right ? PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: You know . No . So they 're , like  um  So they are actually trying to , uh , fix that  those values using the clean , uh , training part of the Wall Street Journal .

Professor B: So they 're set they 're setting it based on that ? PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: OK . So now , we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we can't modify these parameters . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: But , um , PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: uh  but it 's still worth , I think , just  since  you know , just chatting with Joe about the issue . PhD A: Yeah , OK . Do you think that 's something I should just send to him Professor B: Um PhD A: or do you think I should send it to this  there 's an  a m a mailing list . Professor B: Well , it 's not a secret . I mean , we 're , you know , certainly willing to talk about it with everybody , but I think  I think that , um  um , it 's probably best to start talking with him just to PhD A: OK . Professor B: Uh @ @  you know , it 's a dialogue between two of you about what  you know , what does he think about this and what  what  you know  what could be done about it . PhD A: Yeah . OK . Professor B: Um , if you get ten people in  involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: you know . PhD A: Right . Professor B: Uh  But , I mean , I think it all should come up eventually , PhD A: OK . Professor B: but if  if  if there is any , uh , uh , way to move in  a way that would  that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features . But if  if , uh  if there isn't , and it 's just kind of shut down and  and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where  where political issues will come in . PhD A: Yeah . OK . PhD D: Oh . So this is now  it 's  it 's compiled under Solaris ? PhD A: Yeah . PhD D: Yeah , OK . PhD A: Yep . PhD D: Because he  there was some mail r saying that it 's  may not be stable for Linux and all those . PhD A: Yeah . Yeah , i that was a particular version . PhD D: SUSI PhD A: Yeah , SUSI or whatever it was PhD D: yeah . Yeah , yeah . PhD A: but we don't have that . PhD D: Yeah , OK . PhD A: So . Should be OK . PhD D: OK , that 's fine . PhD A: Yeah , it compiled fine actually . PhD D: Yeah . PhD A: No  no errors . Nothing . So . Professor B: Uh , this is slightly off topic PhD D: That 's good . Professor B: but , uh , I noticed , just glancing at the , uh , Hopkins workshop , uh , web site that , uh , um  one of the thing I don't know  Well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a  a , uh , tool kit for doing , uh r um , arbitrary graphical models for , uh , speech recognition . PhD A: Hmm . Professor B: So  And Jeff , uh  the two Jeffs were PhD A: Who 's the second Jeff ? Professor B: Uh  Oh , uh , do you know Geoff Zweig ? PhD A: No . Professor B: Oh . Uh , he  he , uh  he was here for a couple years PhD A: Oh , OK . Professor B: and he , uh  got his PHD . He  And he 's , uh , been at IBM for the last couple years . PhD A: Oh , OK . Professor B: So . PhD A: Wow . That would be neat . Professor B: Uh , so he did  he did his PHD on dynamic Bayes - nets , uh , for  for speech recognition . He had some continuity built into the model , presumably to handle some , um , inertia in the  in the production system , and , um PhD A: Hmm . Professor B: So . PhD D: Hmm . PhD C: Um , I 've been playing with , first , the , um , VAD . Um ,  so it 's exactly the same approach , but the features that the VAD neural network use are , uh , MFCC after noise compensation . Oh , I think I have the results . Professor B: What was it using before ? PhD C: Before it was just P L PhD C: So . PhD D: Yeah , it was actually  No . Not  I mean , it was just the noisy features I guess . PhD C: Yeah , PhD D: Yeah , yeah , yeah , PhD C: noisy  noisy features . PhD D: not compensated . PhD C: Um  This is what we get after  This  So , actually , we , yeah , here the features are noise compensated and there is also the LDA filter . Um , and then it 's a pretty small neural network which use , um ,  nine frames of  of six features from C - zero to C - fives , plus the first derivatives . And it has one hundred hidden units . PhD A: Is that nine frames u s uh , centered around the current frame ? Or PhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm . Professor B: S so , I 'm  I 'm sorry , there 's  there 's  there 's how many  how many inputs ? PhD C: So it 's twelve times nine . Professor B: Twelve times nine inputs , and a hundred , uh , hidden . PhD C: Hidden and PhD D: Two outputs . PhD C: two outputs . Professor B: Two outputs . OK . So I guess about eleven thousand parameters , which  actually shouldn't be a problem , even in  in small phones . Yeah . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: So , I 'm  I 'm  s so what is different between this and  and what you PhD C: It should be OK . So the previous syst It 's based on the system that has a fifty - three point sixty - six percent improvement . It 's the same system . The only thing that changed is the n a p eh  a es the estimation of the silence probabilities . PhD A: Ah . OK . PhD C: Which now is based on , uh , cleaned features . Professor B: And , it 's a l it 's a lot better . PhD A: Wow . PhD C: Yeah . Professor B: That 's great . PhD C: Um  So it 's  it 's not bad , but the problem is still that the latency is too large . Professor B: What 's the latency ? PhD C: Because  um  the  the latency of the VAD is two hundred and twenty milliseconds . And , uh , the VAD is used uh , i for on - line normalization , and it 's used before the delta computation . So if you add these components it goes t to a hundred and seventy , right ? Professor B: I  I 'm confused . You started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy ? PhD C: With two an two hundred and seventy . Professor B: Two - seventy . PhD C: If  Yeah , if you add the c delta comp delta computation Professor B: Oh . PhD C: which is done afterwards . Um Professor B: So it 's two - twenty . I the is this  are these twenty - millisecond frames ? Is that why ? Is it after downsampling ? or PhD C: The two - twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the um  No , it 's forty milliseconds for t for the , uh , uh , cleaning of the speech . Um  then there is , um , the neural network which use nine frames . So it adds forty milliseconds . Professor B: a OK . PhD C: Um , after that , um , you have the um , filtering of the silence probabilities . Which is a million filter it , and it creates a one hundred milliseconds delay . So , um PhD D: Plus there is a delta at the input . PhD C: Yeah , and there is the delta at the input which is , Professor B: One hundred milliseconds for smoothing . PhD C: um  So it 's  @ @ Professor B: Uh , median . PhD D: It 's like forty plus  forty  plus Professor B: And then forty PhD C: Mmm . Forty  This forty plus twenty , plus one hundred . Professor B: forty p PhD C: Uh PhD D: So it 's two hundred actually . PhD C: Yeah , there are twenty that comes from  There is ten that comes from the LDA filters also . Right ? PhD D: Oh , OK . PhD C: Uh , so it 's two hundred and ten , yeah . PhD D: If you are using Professor B: Uh PhD C: Plus the frame , PhD D: t If you are using three frames Professor B: Oh , I know what I was gonna say . PhD C: Um , not  no relation . Professor B: No relation . PhD A: So I  I  I don't understand , PhD C: The f the forty - eight hundred bits is for transmission of some features . PhD A: because i I mean , if you 're only using h PhD C: And generally , i it  s allows you to transmit like , fifteen , uh , cepstrum . Professor B: The issue was that , um , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gonna be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere which might be , you know , it  it might be a concern how many parameters are use  u used and so forth . And so , uh , they felt they wanted to set a limit . So they chose sixty . Some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters and  and that bothered some other people . PhD A: Uh - huh . Professor B: u And so they just chose that . I  I  I think it 's kind of r arbitrary too . But  but that 's  that 's kind of what was chosen . I  I remembered what I was going to say . What I was going to say is that , um , maybe   maybe with the noise removal , uh , these things are now more correlated . So you have two sets of things that are kind of uncorrelated , uh , within themselves , but they 're pretty correlated with one another . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: And , um , they 're being fed into these , uh , variants , only Gaussians and so forth , and  and , uh , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , uh , have , uh , one KLT over everything , to de - correlate it . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah , I see . Professor B: Maybe . You know . PhD D: What are the S N Rs in the training set , TIMIT ? PhD C: It 's , uh , ranging from zero to clean ? Yeah . From zero to clean . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Yeah . So we found this  this , uh  this Macrophone data , and so forth , that we were using for these other experiments , to be pretty good . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So that 's  i after you explore these other alternatives , that might be another way to start looking , is  is just improving the training set . PhD C: Mm - hmm ."}

The tandem net ? Professor B: Yeah , that 's the only place that we can train . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: We can't train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount , PhD A: Right . Professor B: so . Um , um PhD A: What  what was it trained on again ? The one that you used ? PhD C: It 's TIMIT with noise . PhD A: Uh - huh . Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: So , yeah , it 's rather a small Professor B: How big is the net , by the way ? PhD C: Um , Uh , it 's , uh , five hundred hidden units . And Professor B: And again , you did experiments back then where you made it bigger and it  and that was  that was sort of the threshold point . Much less than that , it was worse , PhD C: Yeah . Professor B: and PhD C: Yeah . Professor B: much more than that , it wasn't much better . Hmm . PhD C: Yeah . @ @ ? PhD D: So is it  is it though the performance , big relation in the high ma high mismatch has something to do with the , uh , cleaning up that you  that is done on the TIMIT after adding noise ? PhD D: So  it 's  i All the noises are from the TI - digits , PhD C: Yeah . PhD D: right ? So you  i PhD C: Um  They  k uh PhD D: Well , it it 's like the high mismatch of the SpeechDat - Car after cleaning up , maybe having more noise than the  the training set of TIMIT after clean  s after you do the noise clean - up . PhD C: Mmm . PhD D: I mean , earlier you never had any compensation , you just trained it straight away . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: So it had like all these different conditions of S N Rs , actually in their training set of neural net . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD D: But after cleaning up you have now a different set of S N Rs , right ? PhD C: Yeah . PhD D: For the training of the neural net . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: And  is it something to do with the mismatch that  that 's created after the cleaning up , like the high mismatch PhD C: You mean the  the most noisy occurrences on SpeechDat - Car might be a lot more noisy than PhD D: Mm - hmm . Of  that  I mean , the SNR after the noise compensation of the SpeechDat - Car . Professor B: Oh , so  Right . So the training  the  the neural net is being trained with noise compensated stuff . PhD C: Maybe . PhD D: Yeah . PhD C: Yeah , yeah . Professor B: Which makes sense , PhD D: Yeah . Professor B: but , uh , you 're saying  Yeah , the noisier ones are still going to be , even after our noise compensation , are still gonna be pretty noisy . PhD D: Yeah . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Yeah , so now the after - noise compensation the neural net is seeing a different set of S N Rs than that was originally there in the training set . Of TIMIT . Because in the TIMIT it was zero to some clean . Professor B: Right . Yes . PhD D: So the net saw all the SNR @ @ conditions . Professor B: Right . PhD D: Now after cleaning up it 's a different set of SNR . Professor B: Right . PhD D: And that SNR may not be , like , com covering the whole set of S N Rs that you 're getting in the SpeechDat - Car . Professor B: Right , but the SpeechDat - Car data that you 're seeing is also reduced in noise by the noise compensation . PhD C: Yeah . PhD D: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , it is . But , I 'm saying , there could be some  some issues of Professor B: So . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: Well , if the initial range of SNR is different , we  the problem was already there before . And Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: Because  Mmm Professor B: Yeah , I mean , it depends on whether you believe that the noise compensation is equally reducing the noise on the test set and the training set . PhD C: Hmm . Professor B: Uh PhD D: On the test set , yeah . Professor B: Right ? I mean , you 're saying there 's a mismatch in noise that wasn't there before , PhD D: Hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor B: but if they were both the same before , then if they were both reduic reduced equally , then , there would not be a mismatch . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So , I mean , this may be  Heaven forbid , this noise compensation process may be imperfect , but . Uh , so maybe it 's treating some things differently . PhD C: Yeah , uh PhD D: Well , I  I don't know . I  I just  that could be seen from the TI - digits , uh , testing condition because , um , the noises are from the TI - digits , right ? Noise PhD C: Yeah . So PhD D: So cleaning up the TI - digits and if the performance goes down in the TI - digits mismatch  high mismatch like this PhD C: Clean training , yeah . PhD D: on a clean training , or zero DB testing . PhD C: Yeah , we 'll  so we 'll see . Uh . PhD D: Yeah . PhD C: Maybe . PhD D: Then it 's something to do . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: I mean , one of the things about PhD C: Yeah . Professor B: I mean , the Macrophone data , um , I think , you know , it was recorded over many different telephones . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: And , um , so , there 's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions . I mean , it 's not artificially added noise or anything . So it 's not the same . I don't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car , but  I think it 's  it 's varied enough that if  if doing this adjustments , uh , and playing around with it doesn't , uh , make it better , the most  uh , it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set .

I mean , we weren't talking over a telephone here . But it was just  I think just having a  a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Yep . PhD D: Mmm . PhD C: Yeah , actually  to s eh , what I observed in the HM case is that the number of deletion dramatically increases . It  it doubles . Professor B: Number of deletions . PhD C: When I added the num the neural network it doubles the number of deletions . Yeah , so I don't you know  how to interpret that , but , mmm Professor B: Yeah . Me either . PhD C: t PhD A: And  and did  an other numbers stay the same ? Insertion substitutions stay the same ? PhD C: They p stayed the same , PhD A: Roughly ? PhD C: they  maybe they are a little bit uh , lower . PhD A: Uh - huh . PhD C: They are a little bit better . Yeah . But Professor B: Did they increase the number of deletions even for the cases that got better ? PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Say , for the  I mean , it PhD C: No , it doesn't . Professor B: So it 's only the highly mismatched ? PhD C: No . Professor B: And it  Remind me again , the \" highly mismatched \" means that the PhD C: Clean training and Professor B: Uh , sorry ? PhD C: It 's clean training  Well , close microphone training and distant microphone , um , high speed , I think . Professor B: Close mike training PhD C: Well  The most noisy cases are the distant microphone for testing . Professor B: Right . So  Well , maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech . PhD C: Separating . Yeah . Professor B: Wh PhD C: But  Yeah . I mean , but without the neural network it 's  well , it 's better . It 's just when we add the neural networks . Professor B: Yeah , right . PhD C: The feature are the same except that Professor B: Uh , that 's right , that 's right .

Professor B: But , yeah , actually   the TIMIT noises  are sort of a range of noises and they 're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises , right ? It 's  it 's pretty different .

PhD C: \" Babble \" , it 's a stationary background plus some voices , Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD C: some speech over it . And the other two are rather stationary also . Professor B: Well , I  I think that if you run it  Actually , you  maybe you remember this . When you  in  in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , um , uh , with the  the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ?

PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Was it about the same ? Uh , w i PhD C: It was  b a little bit worse . Professor B: Than  ? PhD C: Than just the features , yeah . Professor B: So , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net wasn't helping at all . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Well , that 's interesting . PhD C: It was helping , uh , if the features are b were bad , Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: I mean . Just plain P L Ps or M F Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: C Cs . as soon as we added LDA on - line normalization , and  all these things , then Professor B: They were doing similar enough things . Well , I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing . PhD C: Yeah , Professor B: And  and the thing I  I have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . PhD C: mm - hmm . Professor B: Maybe that they 're a lot worse . You know ? And , um  But if on the ha other hand , uh , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and  and  and , uh , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a  of a , uh , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on  on , uh , improving the  the net . PhD C: Yeah , Professor B: Um . PhD C: mm - hmm . Professor B: So what 's the overall effe I mean , you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ? But it 's  but of course that one 's weighted lower , PhD C: Y yeah , oh . Yeah . Professor B: so I wonder what the net effect is . PhD C: I d I  I think it 's  it was one or two percent . That 's not that bad , but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car . I have to  to check that . Well , I have  I will . PhD D: Well , it will  overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse , because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five  point two five eight . Professor B: Right . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Hmm . Professor B: Right . So the  so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four , PhD D: Is it like Professor B: and  and , uh , in fact since the others are somewhat better PhD D: Yeah , so it 's four . Is i So either it 'll get cancelled out , or you 'll get , like , almost the same . Professor B: Uh . PhD C: Yeah , it was  it was slightly worse . PhD D: Slightly bad . Yeah . PhD C: Um , Professor B: Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . PhD D: Yeah . PhD A: You know , I 've been wondering about something . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: In the , um  a lot of the , um  the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA . and  and they , um  They run LDA on the features right before they train the models . So there 's the  the LDA is  is right there before the H M PhD D: Yeah . PhD A: So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . PhD D: Uh , this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about . The LDA that you  saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something ,  and then do an LDA on it , PhD A: Yeah . Uh - huh . PhD D: and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that . PhD A: Yeah , you c you c you can . PhD D: And then feed it to HMM . PhD A: I mean , it 's  you know , you 're just basically i PhD D: Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . PhD A: You 're shifting the feature space . Yeah . PhD D: So this is a two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency  high cost frequency . So it 's like  more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r PhD A: Ah . OK . So what i what about , um  i u what i w I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put  ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? PhD D: Uh , it PhD C: Mm - hmm . No , actually , I think  i PhD D: m PhD C: Well . What do we do with the ANN is  is something like that except that it 's not linear . But it 's  it 's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis . PhD A: Yeah . Right , it 's the  It 's  Right . The  So  Yeah , so it 's sort of like PhD C: But . PhD A: The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . PhD C: Yeah . It 's PhD A: I g PhD C: Yeah . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: Yeah . PhD A: But I mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , PhD C: Uh . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I know . That  that  Yeah . Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , but PhD A: Uh - huh . PhD C: Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better . Professor B: The a the argument i is kind of i in  and it 's not like we really know , but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob I mean , discriminative things are good . LDA , neural nets , they 're good . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: Uh , they 're good because you  you  you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . And PCA doesn't do that . It  PAC - PCA  low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not  not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . PhD A: Right . Professor B: But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you  you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is  is something else . PhD A: Uh - huh . Professor B: And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: and then , uh , you  you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that  that doesn't have that , PhD A: Uh - huh . Professor B: and putting those in together . And that  that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the  uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature  uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's  it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these  these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he  he  when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was  was  it didn't help at all in this particular case . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . But by having them both there  The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . PhD A: Mm - hmm . Professor B: And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , PhD A: Right . Professor B: and by combining two information sources if , you know  if  if PhD A: So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that Professor B: That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . PhD A: Yeah , right . Professor B: Now , again , it 's  we 're just trying these different things . We don't really know what 's gonna work best . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . PhD A: Right . Professor B: Um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA . PhD A: Right . Yeah . Well  y Professor B: Though , maybe not . PhD A: Yeah . Exactly . I mean , we , uh  we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , um , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , \" Well , uh , yeah , that i you know  th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . Professor B: Right . PhD A: You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . So . I was just wondering  I  I Professor B: Well , I think that 's a good idea . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: Did  did you do that PhD A: Um . No . Professor B: or  tha that 's a PhD A: That 's what  that 's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing . So . Professor B: Yeah . Yeah . No , well , that 's a good idea . I  I PhD A: We just want to show . Professor B: i Yeah . PhD A: I mean , it  everybody believes it , Professor B: Oh , no it 's a g PhD A: but you know , we just Professor B: No , no , but it might not  not even be true . PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: I mean , it 's  it 's  it 's  it 's  it 's a great idea . I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the  the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people  Because neural nets were pretty easy to  to use  a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh  uh , versions of them . PhD A: Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor B: And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , and  You know , I mean , uh , so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it . PhD A: Yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their  systems now , and so , I that 's what made me wonder about this , Professor B: Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , PhD A: but . Professor B: but  but  but , uh , PhD A: Yeah , what I mean is it 's  it 's like in the Hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got ,  you know , LDA on their features . Professor B: And now they all have that . I see . PhD A: And so . Professor B: Yeah . PhD A: Uh . PhD C: It 's the transformation they 're estimating on  Well , they are trained on the same data as the final HMM are . PhD A: Yeah , so it 's different . Yeah , exactly . Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that  that you guys have . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: I don't know . I  I don't know enough about it , PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: but  Um . Professor B: I mean , part of why  I  I think part of why you were getting into the KLT  Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was  and combining the  the different temporal ranges  was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? So you were just trying  I think you r I mean , this is  it doesn't have the LDA aspect but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: I think you were . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor B: Does something . It doesn't work as well . Yeah . Yeah . PhD D: So , yeah , I 've been exploring a parallel VAD without neural network with , like , less latency using SNR and energy , um , after the cleaning up . So what I 'd been trying was , um , uh  After the b after the noise compensation , n I was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean . So that if  if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech . And if it is n if it is close to zero , which is  So it 's like a scale @ @ probability value . So I was trying , uh , with full band and multiple bands , m ps uh  separating them to different frequency bands and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them . Uh , the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it  if it can Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: g And  it gave me like , uh , one point  One  more than one percent relative improvement . So , from fifty - three point six it went to fifty f four point eight . So it 's , like , only slightly more than a percent improvement ,"}

So I was trying , uh , with full band and multiple bands , m ps uh  separating them to different frequency bands and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them . Uh , the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it  if it can Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: g And  it gave me like , uh , one point  One  more than one percent relative improvement . So , from fifty - three point six it went to fifty f four point eight . So it 's , like , only slightly more than a percent improvement , Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: just like  Which means that it 's  it 's doing a slightly better job than the previous VAD , Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: uh , at a l lower delay . Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Um , so , um Professor B: But  i d I 'm sorry , PhD D: so  u Professor B: does it still have the median  filter stuff ? PhD D: It still has the median filter . Professor B: So it still has most of the delay , PhD D: So Professor B: it just doesn't PhD D: Yeah , so d with the delay , that 's gone is the input , which is the sixty millisecond . The forty plus  twenty . Professor B: Well , w i PhD D: At the input of the neural net you have this , uh , f nine frames of context plus the delta . Professor B: Oh , plus the delta , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: right . OK . PhD D: Yeah . So that delay , plus the LDA . Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Uh , so the delay is only the forty millisecond of the noise cleaning , plus the hundred millisecond smoothing at the output . Professor B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD D: Um . So . Yeah . So the  the  di the biggest  The problem f for me was to find a consistent threshold that works  well across the different databases , because I t I try to make it work on tr SpeechDat - Car Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: and it fails on TI - digits , or if I try to make it work on that it 's just the Italian or something , it doesn't work on the Finnish . Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: So , um . So there are  there was , like , some problem in balancing the deletions and insertions when I try different thresholds . Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: So  The  I 'm still trying to make it better by using some other features from the  after the p clean up  maybe , some , uh , correlation  auto - correlation or some s additional features of  to mainly the improvement of the VAD . I 've been trying . Professor B: Now this  this  this , uh , \" before and after clean \" , it sounds like you think that 's a good feature . That  that , it  you th think that the , uh  the  i it appears to be a good feature , right ? PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: What about using it in the neural net ? PhD D: Yeah . PhD C: Yeah , eventually we could  could just PhD D: Yeah , so  Yeah , so that 's the  Yeah . So we 've been thinking about putting it into the neural net also . Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: Because they did  that itself PhD C: Then you don't have to worry about the thresholds and PhD D: There 's a threshold and  Yeah . Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: but just PhD D: Yeah . So that  that 's , uh Professor B: Yeah . So if we  if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere , then  then that would be a , uh , good thing . PhD D: Yeah . Yeah . Professor B: Um , anybody  has anybody  you guys or  or Naren , uh , somebody , tried the , uh , um , second th second stream thing ? Uh . PhD D: Oh , I just  I just h put the second stream in place and , uh ran one experiment , but just like  just to know that everything is fine . Professor B: Uh - huh . PhD D: So it was like , uh , forty - five cepstrum plus twenty - three mel  log mel . Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: And  and , just , like , it gave me the baseline performance of the Aurora , which is like zero improvement . Professor B: Yeah . Yeah . PhD D: So I just tried it on Italian just to know that everything is  But I  I didn't export anything out of it because it was , like , a weird feature set . Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: So . Professor B: Yeah . Well , what I think , you know , would be more what you 'd want to do is  is  is , uh , put it into another neural net . Right ? PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Professor B: And then  But , yeah , we 're  we 're not quite there yet . So we have to  figure out the neural nets , I guess . PhD C: Yeah . PhD D: The uh , other thing I was wondering was , um , if the neural net , um , has any  because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net , where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional  some four plus some  f few more conditions which it hasn't seen , actually , PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: from the  f f while testing . PhD C: Yeah , yeah . Right . PhD D: Um  instead of just h having c uh , those cleaned up t cepstrum , sh should we feed some additional information , like  The  the  We have the VAD flag . I mean , should we f feed the VAD flag , also , at the input so that it  it has some additional discriminating information at the input ? PhD C: Hmm - hmm ! Um Professor B: Wh - uh , the  the VAD what ? PhD D: We have the VAD information also available at the back - end . Professor B: Uh - huh . PhD D: So if it is something the neural net is not able to discriminate the classes Professor B: Yeah . PhD D: I mean  Because most of it is sil I mean , we have dropped some silence f We have dropped so silence frames ? Professor B: Mm - hmm . PhD D: No , we haven't dropped silence frames still . PhD C: Uh , still not . Yeah . PhD D: Yeah . So PhD C: Th PhD D: the b b biggest classification would be the speech and silence . So , by having an additional , uh , feature which says \" this is speech and this is nonspeech \" , I mean , it certainly helps in some unseen noise conditions for the neural net . PhD A: What  Do y do you have that feature available for the test data ? PhD D: Well , I mean , we have  we are transferring the VAD to the back - end  feature to the back - end . Because we are dropping it at the back - end after everything  all the features are computed . PhD A: Oh , oh , I see . PhD D: So PhD A: I see . PhD D: so the neural  so that is coming from a separate neural net or some VAD . PhD A: OK . OK . PhD D: Which is  which is certainly giving a PhD A: So you 're saying , feed that , also , into  the neural net . PhD D: to  Yeah . So it it 's an  additional discriminating information . PhD A: Yeah . Yeah . Right . PhD D: So that Professor B: You could feed it into the neural net . The other thing  you could do is just , um , p modify the , uh , output probabilities of the  of the , uh , uh , um , neural net , tandem neural net ,  based on the fact that you have a silence probability . PhD D: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Right ? PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: So you have an independent estimator of what the silence probability is , and you could multiply the two things , and renormalize . PhD C: Yeah . Professor B: Uh , I mean , you 'd have to do the nonlinearity part and deal with that . Uh , I mean , go backwards from what the nonlinearity would , you know  would be . PhD D: Through  t to the soft max . Professor B: But  but , uh PhD C: Yeah , so  maybe , yeah , when PhD A: But in principle wouldn't it be better to feed it in ? And let the net do that ? Professor B: Well , u Not sure . PhD A: Hmm . Professor B: I mean , let 's put it this way . I mean , y you  you have this complicated system with thousands and thousand parameters PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: and you can tell it , uh , \" Learn this thing . \" Or you can say , \" It 's silence ! Go away ! \" I mean , I mean , i Doesn't  ? I think  I think the second one sounds a lot more direct . PhD A: What  what if you Professor B: Uh . PhD A: Right . So , what if you then , uh  since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? Professor B: Well , uh , PhD C: That 's what PhD A: Well , I guess that 's the same . Uh , that 's similar . Professor B: Yeah , I mean , y you 'd have to actually run it continuously , PhD A: But I mean  I mean , train the net only on Professor B: but it 's  @ @  Well , no , you want to train on  on the nonspeech also , because that 's part of what you 're learning in it , to  to  to generate , that it 's  it has to distinguish between . PhD D: Speech . PhD A: But I mean , if you 're gonna  if you 're going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision , uh , would  then you don't care about whether the net makes that distinction , right ? Professor B: Well , yeah . But this other thing isn't perfect . PhD A: Ah . Professor B: So that you bring in some information from the net itself . PhD A: Right , OK . That 's a good point . Professor B: Yeah . Now the only thing that  that bothers me about all this is that I  I  I  The  the fact  i i It 's sort of bothersome that you 're getting more deletions . PhD C: Yeah . But  So I might maybe look at , is it due to the fact that um , the probability of the silence at the output of the network , is , uh , Professor B: Is too high . PhD C: too  too high or Professor B: Yeah . So maybe  So PhD C: If it 's the case , then multiplying it again by  i by something ? PhD D: It may not be  it Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Yeah , it  it may be too  it 's too high in a sense , like , everything is more like a , um , flat probability . Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: Oh - eee - hhh . PhD D: So , like , it 's not really doing any distinction between speech and nonspeech PhD C: Uh , yeah . PhD D: or , I mean , different  among classes . Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: Be interesting to look at the  Yeah , for the  I wonder if you could do this . But if you look at the , um , highly mism high mismat the output of the net on the high mismatch case and just look at , you know , the distribution versus the  the other ones , do you  do you see more peaks or something ?

Now the only problem is you don't want to ta I guess wait for the output of the VAD before you can put something into the other system , PhD C: u Professor B: cuz that 'll shoot up the latency a lot , right ? Am I missing something here ? PhD C: But PhD D: Mm - hmm . PhD C: Yeah . Right . Professor B: Yeah . So that 's maybe a problem with what I was just saying . But  but  I I guess PhD A: But if you were gonna put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net , right ? PhD D: Um , well . We  w we don't have it , actually , Professor B: No . PhD D: because it 's  it has a high rate energy PhD A: Ah . PhD D: the VAD has a Professor B: Yeah . PhD A: OK . Professor B: It 's kind of done in  I mean , some of the things are , not in parallel , but certainly , it would be in parallel with the  with a tandem net . PhD A: Right . Professor B: In time . So maybe , if that doesn't work , um  But it would be interesting to see if that was the problem , anyway . And  and  and then I guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you 're feeding into the VAD , and feeding it into the other one as well . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: And then maybe it would just learn  learn it better . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Um  But that 's  Yeah , that 's an interesting thing to try to see , if what 's going on is that in the highly mismatched condition , it 's , um , causing deletions by having this silence probability up  up too high , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: at some point where the VAD is saying it 's actually speech . PhD C: Yeah . Professor B: Which is probably true . PhD C: So , m Professor B: Cuz  Well , the V A if the VAD said  since the VAD is  is  is right a lot , uh PhD C: Yeah . Professor B: Hmm . Anyway . Might be . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: Yeah . Well , we just started working with it . But these are  these are some good ideas I think . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah , and the other thing  Well , there are other issues maybe for the tandem , like , uh , well , do we want to , w uh n Do we want to work on the targets ? Or , like , instead of using phonemes , using more context dependent units ? PhD A: For the tandem net you mean ? PhD C: Well , I 'm  Yeah . PhD A: Hmm . PhD C: I 'm thinking , also , a w about Dan 's work where he  he trained  a network , not on phoneme targets but on the HMM state targets . And  it was giving s slightly better results . Professor B: Problem is , if you are going to run this on different m test sets , including large vocabulary , PhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Professor B: um , PhD C: Uh Professor B: I think PhD C: Mmm . I was just thinking maybe about , like , generalized diphones , and  come up with a  a reasonable , not too large , set of context dependent units , and  and  Yeah . And then anyway we would have to reduce this with the KLT . Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: So . But  I don't know . Professor B: Yeah . Well , maybe . But I d I d it  it  i it 's all worth looking at , PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: but it sounds to me like , uh , looking at the relationship between this and the  speech noise stuff is  is  is probably a key thing . PhD C: Mm - hmm . Professor B: That and the correlation between stuff . PhD A: So if , uh  if the , uh , high mismatch case had been more like the , uh , the other two cases  in terms of giving you just a better performance ,  how would this number have changed ? PhD C: Mm - hmm . Oh , it would be  Yeah . Around five percent better , I guess . If  if  i PhD A: y Like sixty ? Professor B: Well , we don't know what 's it 's gonna be the TI - digits yet . He hasn't got the results back yet . PhD C: Yeah . If you extrapolate the SpeechDat - Car well - matched and medium - mismatch , it 's around , yeah , maybe five . PhD A: Uh - huh . Yeah . So this would be sixty - two ? Professor B: Sixty - two . PhD A: Which is Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: Sixty - two , yeah . PhD D: Somewhere around sixty , must be . Right ? Yeah . PhD C: Well , it 's around five percent , because it 's  s Right ? If everything is five percent . PhD D: Yeah . Yeah . PhD A: All the other ones were five percent , PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD A: the Professor B: Yeah . PhD C: I d I d I just have the SpeechDat - Car right now , so PhD A: Yeah . PhD C: It 's running  it shou we should have the results today during the afternoon , PhD A: Hmm . PhD C: but  Well . Professor B: Hmm . Well  Um  So I won't be here for PhD A: When  When do you leave ? Professor B: Uh , I 'm leaving next Wednesday . May or may not be in in the morning . I leave in the afternoon . Um , PhD A: But you 're Professor B: so I PhD A: are you  you 're not gonna be around this afternoon ? Professor B: Yeah . PhD A: Oh . Professor B: Oh , well . I 'm talking about next week . I 'm leaving  leaving next Wednesday . PhD A: Uh - huh . Professor B: This afternoon  uh  Oh , right , for the Meeting meeting ? Yeah , that 's just cuz of something on campus . PhD A: Ah , OK , OK . Professor B: Yeah . But , um , yeah , so next week I won't , and the week after I won't , cuz I 'll be in Finland . And the week after that I won't . By that time you 'll be   Uh , you 'll both be gone  from here . So there 'll be no  definitely no meeting on  on September sixth . Uh , PhD A: What 's September sixth ? Professor B: and  Uh , that 's during Eurospeech . PhD A: Oh , oh , right . OK . Professor B: So , uh , Sunil will be in Oregon . Uh , Stephane and I will be in Denmark . Uh  Right ? So it 'll be a few weeks , really , before we have a meeting of the same cast of characters . Um , but , uh  I guess , just  I mean , you guys should probably meet . And maybe Barry  Barry will be around . And  and then uh , uh , we 'll start up again with Dave and  Dave and Barry and Stephane and us on the , uh , twentieth . No . Thirteenth ? About a month ? PhD A: So , uh , you 're gonna be gone for the next three weeks or something ? Professor B: I 'm gone for two and a half weeks starting  starting next Wed - late next Wednesday . PhD A: So that 's  you won't be at the next three of these meetings . Is that right ? Professor B: Uh , I won't  it 's probably four because of  is it three ? Let 's see , twenty - third , thirtieth , sixth . That 's right , next three . And the  the third one won't  probably won't be a meeting , cuz  cuz , uh , Su - Sunil , Stephane , and I will all not be here . PhD A: Oh , right . Right . Professor B: Um  Mmm .  So it 's just , uh , the next two where there will be  there , you know , may as well be meetings , PhD A: OK . Professor B: but I just won't be at them . And then starting up on the thirteenth ,  uh , we 'll have meetings again but we 'll have to do without Sunil here somehow . PhD A: When do you go back ? Professor B: So . PhD D: Thirty - first , August . Professor B: Yeah . Yeah . So . Cool . PhD A: When is the evaluation ? November , or something ? Professor B: Yeah , it was supposed to be November fifteenth . Has anybody heard anything different ? PhD C: I don't know . The meeting in  is the five and six of December . So PhD D: p s It 's like  Yeah , it 's tentatively all full . Yeah . PhD C: Mm - hmm . PhD D: Uh , that 's a proposed date , I guess . PhD C: Yeah , um  so the evaluation should be on a week before or PhD A: Yeah . Professor B: Yep . But , no , this is good progress . So . Uh  OK . PhD A: Should we do digits ? Professor B: Guess we 're done . Digits ? Yep ."}

Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . Project Manager: And why not wood ? Industrial Designer: And , Project Manager: And why not wood ? Industrial Designer: hmm ?  Uh , well we can use wood .  I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . So that's what I've got on design . Project Manager: 'S good . Marketing: Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material Project Manager: Hmm . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: which is quite shocking . Marketing: Ha . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the  is the current trend Marketing: and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . For fashion , we go for fashion . Project Manager: Mm . Marketing: The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to  I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , Marketing: but that's just a personal opinion . Marketing: I think Marketing: I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . Marketing: Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? Marketing: Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find  come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Marketing: Thank you for your attention . User Interface: So . Project Manager: I think it's the next  it's the blue one , yeah . User Interface: Oh , uh , there we go .  Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . User Interface: I actually wasn't aware of the  new trends in electronics User Interface: and and uh Marketing: Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um  fabrics . Project Manager: Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . User Interface: So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh  Okay , alright anyway . Um  here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying  we're gonna try to talk about , um  what kind of uh  how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . User Interface: And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system .  Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of  I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ? Project Manager: Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . User Interface: 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this  it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um  the wheel Project Manager: You need a screen for it ? User Interface: you  it seems like you would need a screen . Industrial Designer: You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With TV channels it's , you know , one two three . So User Interface: But like if you think about it  yeah but if  so is it just  okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? Project Manager: We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ , User Interface: Are we Project Manager: that was one of th I I was Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: sorry , Project Manager: I I meant to update you on that . Um . User Interface: Alright . Okay . Marketing: But the screen can come up on the telly , the  she said . User Interface: Okay . Okay . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: That correct ? User Interface: So anyway if  well we just  we need to  Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen  I think  I was thinking  okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna  I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a  right . Marketing: Graphical interface ? User Interface: Yeah like you're g Marketing: Uh on the  you can have it on the telly though . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can  okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: So that    people seems to be  well Project Manager: You've  Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to User Interface: You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um  I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because  So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if  or or  then again if you just  I guess  I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the TV like what channel you're on . Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or Marketing: Yeah , yeah . Project Manager: But but imagine someone with s Industrial Designer: My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the TV . User Interface: I oh yeah ? Project Manager: But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to User Interface: 'Cause you'll have to like Marketing: Yeah . Industrial Designer: They have to r wheel really fast . User Interface: but you can quickly s you can Project Manager: Yeah ."}

User Interface: Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be  you  I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um  So you're either  you're  you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like  from five to six you could tap or someth Project Manager: Right . User Interface: And then there's also the concern about you know um  how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um  you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , Project Manager: Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd   uh  I'd think that the screen would be better , User Interface: like Project Manager: because you could have that menu option , sort of User Interface: I would think so too , like  So I mean  and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: but then again it would  it does make kind of  if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of Project Manager: Yeah . Industrial Designer: It's more expensive according to the design people . User Interface: m yeah . Project Manager: Uh . User Interface: Yeah , that's the only thing though . Industrial Designer: You have to get a  an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . User Interface: Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um Project Manager: Mm . User Interface: You can get to  you know , you can  Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can  it brings up like the menu on the TV Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Project Manager: Mm . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the Marketing: Yeah . Project Manager: So the TV is the screen , that  yeah User Interface: yeah , yeah . Project Manager: So it would have all these different options of changing User Interface: Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up . Project Manager: to Marketing: Look it even has settings . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Hmm ? Marketing: On the Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: you can just take theirs and just User Interface: Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess , Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: but um  'cause that just  it does seem like , it  that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but  I dunno , and then  so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . User Interface: So Project Manager: Um , right . What if  I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , Project Manager: or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or User Interface: It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the TV . Project Manager: Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean User Interface: Yeah . Yeah definitely . Project Manager: okay . User Interface: Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: I mean it it needs to be easy to Marketing: Yeah but should be comfortable . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: I mean how do how do  I'm not really  Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So Project Manager: Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah . User Interface: Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So Marketing: Yeah I use it like that . Industrial Designer: W when we had the wheely remote control , we  it was on the top I think , if you held it like that . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Yeah ."}

User Interface: Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can Project Manager: What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ?

User Interface: So Project Manager: So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this  how they actually programme these things , and if that's User Interface: Mean Industrial Designer: Oh how they make the menu show up on the TV ? Project Manager: yeah . I mean it  would y would  that would be Industrial Designer: I don't know . User Interface: I mean you can do it , Marketing: They already do it . Industrial Designer: I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the TV , not inside the remote . User Interface: you  it's  it doesn't seem that hard . I mean I've never bought a remote . Industrial Designer: I'm not sure . User Interface: It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , Industrial Designer: Well they usually are . User Interface: which is a little Industrial Designer: Well User Interface: My  I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know . Marketing: No . Project Manager: Huh . User Interface: But um Industrial Designer: I guess that's right . It always comes with the TV . User Interface: So , um  but I mean it's  I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard . Industrial Designer: Yeah , it  most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something . User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Well so  So , do we need  I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about  But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . User Interface: That's what it does anyway . Marketing: But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you  like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah , Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like Marketing: and I never get it . Project Manager: yeah . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Never ever . User Interface: So , but Marketing: So User Interface: oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? Marketing: Well on the telly . Industrial Designer: Or on the TV too . User Interface: On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea User Interface: because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those  like okay now I hit this  you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .

User Interface: Yeah . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Project Manager: Yeah . User Interface: Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or Marketing: Yeah . Marketing: And it could  the colour can fit your sitting room , Marketing: so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have  well I don't know .

Project Manager: Yeah , th and that would  that User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: Okay . Industrial Designer: Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . User Interface: Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . User Interface: But uh it Industrial Designer: Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again . User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: No but it does it automatically . Marketing: Does it automatically ? User Interface: Yeah . Marketing: I don't know . Project Manager: I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . Project Manager: But if someone Marketing: Okay . Project Manager: components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark . Industrial Designer: That was me . Project Manager: Was that you ? Industrial Designer: Yes . Project Manager: Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And Industrial Designer: Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , Industrial Designer: which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches . Marketing: Oh , a dynamo is  ah ,  it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . Industrial Designer: Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . Industrial Designer: So I sort of picked battery . Marketing: It's quite sweet . Industrial Designer: We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways . Project Manager: I think batteries sound good . Industrial Designer: It  it seems a little weird for a living room anyways . Project Manager: What does everyone else think ? User Interface: The dynamo would be interesting  . Marketing: No . But dynamo  the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it  creates energy on its own . Project Manager: What about Kryptonite ? User Interface: Oh . Marketing: Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Don't know the cost . Industrial Designer: Didn't have enough data to actually Marketing: Does anyone have costs on the on the web ? Industrial Designer: All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost . Marketing: Okay . Right . User Interface: Hmm . Marketing: Mm . Industrial Designer: Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem . Like the chip is probably the most expensive part . Project Manager: What does chip on print mean ? Industrial Designer: Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , Project Manager: Uh-huh . Industrial Designer: calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip . Project Manager: Right . So , chip on print is just  means like that they're mass-produced . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about , Industrial Designer: Case is what we were discussing yeah . Project Manager: yeah . Casing . Yeah .  thinking of like syntactic case and thi Project Manager: um  let's see . Is there anything else we need to User Interface: Hmm ."}

Marketing: Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um  the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional  uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , Project Manager: It's okay  . Marketing: sorry Project Manager  . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .  Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . Project Manager: Yeah . Marketing: Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that . User Interface: 'Kay . Project Manager: Okay thank you very much . Um User Interface: Yep . Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . Marketing: Unless anyone has any questions about that ? Project Manager: I don't think so , not yet . Marketing: Not yet ? 'Kay . Project Manager: Um , yes , thank you . Marketing: Okay . Project Manager: I hate those little things Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them . Marketing: I know . Industrial Designer: 'Kay , Industrial Designer: Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the  Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't  un unfortunately aren't available . Project Manager: 'Kay .  . Industrial Designer: Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the moment . Project Manager: 'Kay . Industrial Designer: Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options . Industrial Designer: There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we  I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , Project Manager: Wa  can you explain that ? Industrial Designer: people won't  it's it's basically like wind-up radio . Project Manager: Like a  right , okay . Industrial Designer: So you wind up your remote control before you use it . Project Manager: How   what kind of  how l long can you get out of that , Industrial Designer: It might Project Manager: I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or Industrial Designer: You  Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get  when when you got TV . Project Manager: That doesn't count though does it ? Marketing: Does does light charge as as sunlight does ? Project Manager: I thought it was U_V_ like Industrial Designer: No . Marketing: Artificial light ? Industrial Designer: Is it ? Alright i Project Manager: Any , any Marketing: Has to be solar . User Interface: Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or  and dynamo might take more space . Industrial Designer: Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . Project Manager: I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . Project Manager: Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights Marketing: Mm . Artificial light , no .

Industrial Designer: Yeah User Interface: Right . Industrial Designer: and most people most people also watch TV in the in the night anyway . User Interface: Night .

Industrial Designer: The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches Project Manager: Yeah I've seen Industrial Designer: and you d you don't even notice it .

If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .

Can we  what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of Industrial Designer: Well well this  the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have  fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . Industrial Designer: if you if you wanted to but um the  there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit Project Manager: Okay . Industrial Designer: so that  And then to  uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was  'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a TV remote , Project Manager: Mm-hmm . User Interface: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . User Interface: Okay . Industrial Designer: Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the  there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case  case housing Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: and the the main problems with the  well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process , Project Manager: Mm . Industrial Designer: which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , Marketing: Mm . Industrial Designer: but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ . Marketing: Okay . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite  um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more  they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not  because we'd have it in two separate units User Interface: Second thing is Project Manager: Hinged , yeah . Industrial Designer: for the flip phone . User Interface: yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . Marketing: Mm . User Interface: So is that feature available in like uh titanium , Industrial Designer: Yeah I th User Interface: or it's like only specific to plastic or Industrial Designer: Uh . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just Marketing: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is User Interface: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote . Marketing: It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Marketing: I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , Industrial Designer: Rubber , yeah .

Project Manager: Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean Industrial Designer: Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest . Project Manager: Uh Marketing: I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ .  Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to  . Industrial Designer: Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out Project Manager: Like one of the palm pop thing .

Marketing: They're easy to replace as well , cheap . Industrial Designer: Hmm .

User Interface: and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Marketing: Mm . Industrial Designer: Yeah okay . Marketing: Yeah just a thought  they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a Project Manager: Okay , we'll talk about that  so if you finish your Industrial Designer: Yeah that's Project Manager: and we'll come back to that . Industrial Designer: yeah that  that's the end of m my Project Manager: That's you , right okay . User Interface: And just one small question before like you are  , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . Industrial Designer: Uh yeah . Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , User Interface: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate  you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , User Interface: Okay . Okay . Marketing: Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer: 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking . Marketing: I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in . Industrial Designer: Mm . Marketing: If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? Project Manager: No . Marketing: And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display  th uh the remote control display thing .

Marketing: that was just a very quick passing thought yeah  . User Interface: Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility .

Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: and g graphic user interface Marketing: Sorry what does that stand for ? Project Manager: Which means User Interface: basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , Marketing: Okay . Industrial Designer: Yeah . User Interface: which is Industrial Designer: If you if  yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this LCD screen . User Interface: Like you have on a l uh  icons or something y you have  is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface . Industrial Designer: Yeah . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: So basically  not point or click   Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . Project Manager: Mm-hmm . User Interface: So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .

Beautiful . Industrial Designer: Beautiful . Project Manager: Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions  well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um  the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number .  Um Project Manager: we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development ,  um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . Industrial Designer: Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh Project Manager: Limitations . Industrial Designer: influations influences . Project Manager: Okay . User Interface: Okay . Project Manager: Okay , great . Industrial Designer: Okay ?  Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one .  Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but  well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . User Interface: Okay . Industrial Designer: I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device  diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment . User Interface: And for a cell phone ? Industrial Designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . User Interface: Yeah , okay . Yeah . Industrial Designer: I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh Industrial Designer: is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth . User Interface: But  Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . User Interface: But all the TVs are uh equipped with infrared , so Industrial Designer: But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all . User Interface: y you you can  Most of them . Industrial Designer: So that's the point . User Interface: Or you shou sh use a Industrial Designer: So User Interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .

Project Manager: H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? User Interface: Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different TVs or even different uh um  Yeah uh , what is it , devices ? Project Manager: Yep . User Interface: Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . Industrial Designer: Yes , I think it should be something like that . User Interface: It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , Project Manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , User Interface: right ? Project Manager: not  we're we're  it's not a User Interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh  don't have the information for it . Industrial Designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? Project Manager: No . No . Industrial Designer: No , User Interface: No , okay .
