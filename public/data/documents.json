{"meeting_id": "m_test_0", "domain": "committee", "meeting_transcripts": ["Lynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David and Jack Sargeant. Vikki Howells is substituting for Jack Sargeant. So, Vikki, welcome; it's good to see you in the committee. Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. So thank you all for attending this afternoon. We're really looking forward to hearing your views on the Bill. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.", "Barry Hughes: Perfectly happy.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands, and how do you think the law as it currently stands today, and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment\u2014how does that protect children.", "Barry Hughes: Sorry, can I just be clear? How does the law as it presently stands protect children?", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes.", "Barry Hughes: We have a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, does provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. In respect of children in particular, you'll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. That is a defence that is available for assault upon a child. By way of contrast, it is not available for an offence involving an adult. In that regard, it could be argued that children have fewer rights than adults.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Well, a review was undertaken by the Government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form\u2014that that would be the best thing to do because there's no evidence that it's not working satisfactorily. You are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that's happened since 2007.", "Barry Hughes: I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that. We don't need to go back a very long way to find, for example, that there was no such offence as raping one's married wife, and the law has changed to reflect the fact that that is simply not acceptable. And from what I've seen of the research, and I think back to the 2007 review, to which you've just referred, there is evidence within that review already that opinions are changing. And I've seen research more current than that that suggests that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastising a child than do people of an older generation. Of course, as we move forward in time, the people who are young now are going to be the older adults of the future. So one would hope that the law will change to reflect the way in which people behave within society.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you. We have heard evidence as a committee that this proposed law would provide a much clearer legal framework\u2014that is, to take out this reasonable punishment defence, that then would make things much clearer for parents and professionals. Does the CPS have a view on that?", "Barry Hughes: I think it will make things clearer. I'm not sure it will make them much clearer, because if we get into some of the\u2014. It may be helpful to look at some examples at some stage. And when it comes to prosecuting, it's often the case that things aren't just black and white; there are multiple shades of grey in between. We know that the Children Act did introduce a degree of clarity, in that it removed the defence of reasonable chastisement for offences of causing actual bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and various incidents of child cruelty under the Children and Young Persons Act. In that sense, matters were clarified, because up until that point it was not entirely clear. There were a series of Court of Appeal cases that sought to clarify the law, but that was at a time, at the end of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, when we had the European convention on human rights and we had a quickly developing body of case law. And the Children Act was brought in to reflect the direction that the case law was moving in. A decision was clearly made back then in the early 2000s not to include common assault in the same category as actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm et cetera. So, there was a decision made back then that it was appropriate to do that. As we wind forward some 15 years, I have seen the research that suggests that some people see that the present legislation, and the way in which section 58 applies to reasonable chastisement for common assault of children\u2014some people have interpreted that as saying that smacking is acceptable. I don't think that it is what it says, but there is a degree of confusion around that. And the reason why I say it's not as simple as that is, going back to my words a couple of minutes ago, it's rarely a case of being black and white; there are these degrees of grey. And removing that defence does make life clearer.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: What are the areas of grey that you refer to? Can you give a few examples?", "Barry Hughes: If you take an example\u2014so, one of the examples that I've heard discussed has been a child\u2014a young child; let's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road\u2014who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic. The parent grabs hold of the child and pulls them back. Now, technically, taking hold of the child at that point is an assault, because it's an unwanted imposition of physical force. But no-one's going to say that's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts. Of course, that would be utter nonsense. There's no hostility; it's simply taking hold of a child to protect them. At that point, the parent then seeks to admonish the child, tells them off and smacks the child on the legs. Now, that would probably be seen under the present law as reasonable chastisement. Probably. But so much depends upon the circumstances, whether this is something that happens frequently with the child, the size of the child, the parent, the force of the slap, the way in which it's imposed. So, that, I would say, sits at one end of the spectrum. As we move towards the other end of the spectrum, we might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. So, there is a spectrum of offending. Towards one end of the spectrum we move much closer towards something that would be criminal in nature. There'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police, and the police would take some form of action, and then, as we move through the tiers, it'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. We would then decide the most appropriate means of dealing with it. And the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court. That would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that I've just described to you. Does that help to illustrate that, at one end, it's relatively white and the other end it's relatively black, but in the middle we have the shades of grey?", "Sian Gwenllian AM: But that would mean that there could be more prosecutions at the softer end. Because if you're removing this\u2014we'll probably come on to that.", "Barry Hughes: Shall I address that in terms\u2014? Okay. So, you are probably aware, but forgive me if I just explain quickly anyway, when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is\u2014. And you only get to the second stage if the first stage is satisfied. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, we only get on to the public interest stage once the evidential stage is satisfied. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. It's a matter for them whether they refer a matter to the Crown Prosecution Service. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case\u2014the light smacking on the leg\u2014at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think\u2014and I think this is what will probably happen in practice\u2014that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. It may be that the police decide that it is\u2014it may have been two smacks, three smacks, so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious. So, it may be referred to the CPS for a charging decision. We would then apply independently the same test, and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists, which takes us on to considering the public interest. In the circumstances that I've described, every case is going to be unique on its own facts, but in the circumstances that I've described, if it is just a light smack and it's a one-off and there's no history of this, it would probably be the sort of offence we'd decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: But isn't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that? Do you know what I'm saying?", "Barry Hughes: If this Bill goes through, then it will remove a defence, which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the CPS than beforehand, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will refer it, because it will depend on the facts of each individual case.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Thanks.", "Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in England and Wales from Dawn Bowden.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Hello. The Assembly doesn't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the CPS, as you know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that?", "Barry Hughes: Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this\u2014and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing\u2014that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. And so, there are issues there in terms of the awareness of members of the public. The second example that I'll give you is that we already have within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example I'll give to you is this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 \u00b5g in 100 ml of breath. Across the border in Scotland, it drops to 22 \u00b5g. So, the same act\u2014. As you drive into Scotland, you're probably okay to drive if you've got 34 \u00b5g; by the time you get into Scotland, you won't be. And the consequences for you are significant, because of course it's an offence in Scotland, and not an offence in England, but the punishment, namely disqualification, applies everywhere in the United Kingdom. So, we already have a degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognises this. In our code, we have a specific provision that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law. We will issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise. And we think that we are sufficiently flexible to take account of that.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that?", "Barry Hughes: Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. There will be a further series of awareness raising. We have strategic implementation groups\u2014Iwan sits on that group. So, we would build ourselves up to come up with the appropriate guidance according to the circumstances. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, we would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences\u2014and we might want to get into the number of potential offences, but my take on it is the number of offences is likely to be very small and we would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that comes through goes to people who've got a close network and can talk with each other\u2014", "Dawn Bowden AM: And that would be primarily around the public interest issue.", "Barry Hughes: It would.", "Dawn Bowden AM: I understand. Okay. So you're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications. What's actually been your involvement with the Government as they've been developing this legislation?", "Barry Hughes: My own personal involvement?", "Dawn Bowden AM: Or the service's.", "Barry Hughes: Iwan and colleagues have had some involvement on a more routine basis. I met with a Minister and a Deputy Minister\u2014I met with Huw Irranca-Davies a little while ago, and I met with Julie Morgan a few months ago\u2014to discuss the overall implications, and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other. It hasn't been a very close-knit involvement, but we have had enough involvement so that we've felt we've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. So you've been satisfied with the level of involvement that you've had.", "Barry Hughes: Yes. I don't feel that it's been too much, nor do I feel we've been left on the side at all.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Now, we've just talked about the divergence of criminal law, and this is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance.", "Barry Hughes: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that.", "Dawn Bowden AM: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales\u2014well, and in England, actually, across the border\u2014will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law?", "Barry Hughes: Not as of the present day. Give us a chance. [Laughter.]", "Dawn Bowden AM: But you would expect that to be something you would\u2014", "Barry Hughes: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. So, actually, I'm probably being unfair to myself. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes?", "Barry Hughes: They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. We have regular interchange of prosecutors between England and Wales. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law.", "Dawn Bowden AM: That's helpful, thank you. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation.", "Barry Hughes: In addition to those that I've mentioned, probably not. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. That's fine. Thank you, Chair.", "Lynne Neagle AM: I've got a supplementary from Suzy, and then Si\u00e2n.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. I was going to ask this question later, but I think it fits in\u2014. I've forgotten what I was going to ask; this is terrible. Oh no, that's right\u2014obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers\u00a0of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision?", "Barry Hughes: I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. I've had some discussions with Kwame, who would have an involvement in this. What we would envisage is that we would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which are set out, in my view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and we would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that we're discussing here. So, it would be taking principles of generality and according them a degree of specificity. And we'd need to work that up as we go along, and I think you'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse, if I may put it like that.", "Suzy Davies AM: It's just that, personally, I think the public interest test is critical in all this, and it would really help us to understand what it could look like before we commit to a particular course of action in supporting or not supporting the Bill, that was all. But thank you, anyway; I take your point.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Si\u00e2n.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: My point is about the criminal law in Wales and England diverging in this particular instance, and we've been told that this is probably the first time it's happened. Can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion?", "Barry Hughes: There are other offences in Wales that don't exist in England, but they don't crop up very often. So, to give you examples, there is an offence of putting an electronic collar on your pet\u2014let's not stretch that into children. [Laughter.] But, you know, sometimes\u2014I'll be quiet. But putting an electronic collar on your pet that administers a shock is an offence in Wales; it's not an offence in England. There are also offences around the picking of cockles in west Wales, which is not an offence\u2014. So, you can see there are some, but I would argue that the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England is possibly more significant for the general public. Of course, the topic we're discussing here is of real relevance for the general public, and you have heard evidence, I know, already, that comes from people who are quite strongly in favour and people quite strongly against it. One of the ways in which I've approached this is looking at it from the perspective of what the law is there for, which is to set out, in essence, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to use the law for that, but it signifies how society views a certain behaviour. I like to look at it from the perspective of the person who is being affected by this, namely the child, and the change in the law here would afford children a degree of protection that they don't presently have, but which they do have when they attain the age of 16.FootnoteLink So, I looked at this\u2014. If I can give you another example. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. Sometimes they admonish them verbally and then that turns into physical admonishment. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying\u2014but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. That seems to me to not necessarily fit with where we ought to be as a society.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Do you think that what we're doing in Wales will be emulated in England at some point?", "Barry Hughes: Well, it's certainly going through in parallel in Scotland, and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this, including a large number of European countries. Who knows? Trying to get any legislation through Westminster at the moment\u2014who knows? Not tomorrow, I'd say.", "Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some specific questions around implementation now from Suzy Davies.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. Can I just begin by asking you to help the committee out here in understanding how the burden of proof is going to work if this defence is removed? Because the issue of whether something is punishment or not is going to disappear, providing that it's clear that contact with a child has happened. Is that going to work on the presumption that that's an unlawful contact? Is that something the prosecution will still have to prove, or will it be for an accused parent to say, to use your example, 'I was just dragging them out of the traffic or stopping them putting their hands in the fire'?", "Barry Hughes: I understand your point. There's no change whatsoever to the burden of proof, nor to the standard of proof.", "Suzy Davies AM: Perhaps you can run us through it quickly.", "Barry Hughes: If the defence argue that that act was\u2014. So, we have to show that there's been an unlawful assault. So, if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement, in a sense that alters some things but it doesn't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution, which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And if the defence raise an argument and say, 'Well, look, that was a lawful act; I was only doing what I thought was reasonable in the circumstances', it's for the Crown to disprove that.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. That's great.", "Barry Hughes: And we've got to disprove that to the criminal standard, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. So, you can certainly see\u2014. I can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter, to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial, and it would be our responsibility to disprove that.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. That's really helpful for us to understand that. Obviously, when we're talking about CPS guidelines and all the rest, we've already come some distance down the process, haven't we? Have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest? Because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you're arrested, that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like DBS checks in the future, even if it goes no further. Do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on, even at the point of the knock at the door?", "Barry Hughes: From the perspective of the CPS, I'm not sure I can help you there.", "Suzy Davies AM: That's fine. I was expecting that answer.", "Barry Hughes: Simply because that's a matter for the police. Unlike in many other jurisdictions, we have no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decide not to investigate\u2014. I routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something, and they want us to do something about it and we can't. We can't direct the police.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you for that, because I thought that was important to get on the record as well. We're looking at a period of a couple of years after this Act passes\u2014if it does\u2014for implementation. Is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law?", "Barry Hughes: I think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we've built up with the Welsh Government and colleagues there. I think we need to keep abreast of things as they move forward. We need involvement\u2014Iwan, for example, and the strategic implementation group. We have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and I believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected; that we can liaise, in turn, with Kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop. So, I think we've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose\u2014at least, 'adequate' might sound a little\u2014", "Suzy Davies AM: Sufficient.", "Barry Hughes: Yes, perfectly sufficient.", "Suzy Davies AM: So, you're confident, by 2022, then, that you'll have changes to the CPS guidelines that are good to go, if you like.", "Barry Hughes: Fit for purpose, yes.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes. Okay, that's great. Bear with me a second\u2014thank you very much\u2014in your written evidence, you did welcome the indication from the Welsh Government that this reasonable period after Royal Assent would be necessary. Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this?", "Barry Hughes: If this legislation goes through, there will be minor financial consequences for us and I don't see any significant financial consequences in the period between now and the Bill becoming law other than the time of ourselves in discussing this today. But there isn't anything significant. There's nothing that will impact upon our performance as the public prosecution service in that time.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this.", "Barry Hughes: Certainly. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will\u2014. Normally, we do this through our case management system, which is England-and-Wales wide, and you'd put a flag on. So, for example, domestic abuse, there's a flag for that, and assault on a child, there's a flag for that. But this would be a very specific flag for assault on a child\u2014reasonable chastisement. Trying to get that through on a system that covers all of England and Wales\u2014it's quite expensive, unbelievably; it wouldn't happen. So, we would keep a manual log of every referral. That would be unmanageable if we were dealing with hundreds and hundreds of cases.", "Suzy Davies AM: So, you're not anticipating hundreds and hundreds.", "Barry Hughes: Not at all. Not at all. My take on it: I've seen and spoken with Matt Jukes about this, from South Wales Police; I have seen the justice impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. If that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. So, you're talking small numbers. Now, small numbers\u2014and we might not have any. Okay? It depends. Obviously, if there's a really good awareness-raising campaign, you make it less likely. And, for us, prosecution\u2014it's not the first port of call here at all. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever\u201412, 18 months, maybe 24 months\u2014where we'd look back to see how we are doing. And I'd like to think that we will be doing that in consultation with interested parties and stakeholders. We do this already with certain types of offences. We have what we call local scrutiny involvement panels. So, for offences such as racially aggravated offending, whether it's criminal damage or offence against the person, we will bring together interested parties, by which I mean people from outside the CPS, quite often third sector agencies that represent vulnerable groups. We'd bring them in and look through the cases. So, we open our books, show them our cases, and we have a very frank discussion. We involve the police in that as well. That, in turn, helps us shape and improve the way that we prosecute these cases and I can foresee that, after this legislation came in, we might get 18 months, two years down the road, and I can see us sitting in a room with some of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how we're doing with it all. And I'd like to think that the Welsh Government would be involved in that as well.", "Suzy Davies AM: That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. It's nobody's fault; that's just how it is. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example\u2014the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question.", "Barry Hughes: I can attempt an answer. I follow entirely where you're going. I agree, the chances are pretty low, but they're greater than they are presently. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay, that's really helpful, thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Before we move on, can I just ask\u2014? The Children Act 2004 applies to a child up to the age of 18\u2014", "Barry Hughes: Sixteen.", "Lynne Neagle AM: You mentioned 16; that's what I wanted to clarify. Our understanding was that it went up to 18.", "Barry Hughes: I'm reasonably confident that it's 16.FootnoteLink", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now specifically on prosecutions and potential alternatives from Vikki Howells.", "Vikki Howells AM: Thank you, Chair. You've already touched quite a bit on the issue of the public interest test. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill?", "Barry Hughes: Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. Now, there comes a point in time when the defence stops applying. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. Some of them are fairly obvious, such as previous convictions. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. But there's no part of the law that says that prosecution will always follow. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted.", "Vikki Howells AM: Thank you, that's really useful, and\u2014", "Lynne Neagle AM: Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Now, I've looked at the code and there is a section about impact on the victim. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution?", "Barry Hughes: Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. It may be that there are\u2014. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. It's not determinative but it is a factor that we take into account.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy, you've got a supplementary on that.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed.", "Barry Hughes: That's a really interesting question. There is a body of law that\u2014", "Suzy Davies AM: A child can't consent to assault.", "Barry Hughes: Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. The law is really quite difficult. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. That went too far as well. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. So, the law has considered that in some depth. I'm still not entirely clear, and I speak as a lawyer. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes, because we're talking below a certain standard here as well. Okay.", "Barry Hughes: As to what you can consent to, it's less clear. It would need to be developed.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you for that.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Vikki.", "Vikki Howells AM: Thank you. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option?", "Barry Hughes: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. Their lead is deputy chief constable Sara Glen. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. Any case that the police refer to us for a charging decision is going to be something\u2014. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say\u2014for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth\u2014we\u00a0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering\u00a0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility\u2014that will fall to the police\u2014but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. Does that help?", "Vikki Howells AM: It does. One final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this Bill\u2014how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited?", "Barry Hughes: The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved\u2014the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction.", "Vikki Howells AM: And who would build that infrastructure, in your opinion?", "Barry Hughes: Somewhere within Wales\u2014Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. It may be that the police and crime commissioners use some of their commissioning powers to work something up. I'm not the right person to answer that question.", "Vikki Howells AM: Okay. Thank you, Chair.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. There's no such duty proposed in this Bill. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales?", "Barry Hughes: I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example?", "Barry Hughes: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here\u2014by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes\u2014if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on the unintended consequences from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence.", "Barry Hughes: Yes. Okay. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. It may be\u2014the sort of circumstance I can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'Prosecute me'. We probably would end up prosecuting, because it's a relatively serious offence. So, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in England\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. But I think, along the road there, there would have been an element of choice.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And do you think that that would be an isolated incident?", "Barry Hughes: Yes, truly, I believe, an isolated incident. I've said before that I would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. They're likely to be very limited. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Thank you for that. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures?", "Barry Hughes: I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. In the CPS, we don't have targets for securing convictions or not. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets\u2014it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: What about\u2014? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence?", "Barry Hughes: I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. That disappeared some years ago. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. The police are required to report against this, but we don't have targets. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. It's much less of an issue than it ever was\u2014much.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. This happens now, of course. Is that going to increase if we change the law?", "Barry Hughes: There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Regrettably, there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. I can see it potentially arising. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law?", "Barry Hughes: No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. And I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point.", "Barry Hughes: Right. How to approach that one? In the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the Government, the then Government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the European convention. There are various parties who would disagree with that, but that was the then Government's position. If Wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, Wales would be more in compliance with ECHR than not, and England would be less so. But nonetheless, at present, I haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case I referred to, Regina v H, which was heard back in 2001 in the Court of Appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the UK\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the European Union.", "Barry Hughes: It could, but I would be a foolish man if I were to say what impact European jurisprudence might have upon us. [Laughter.]", "Suzy Davies AM: [Inaudible.]\u2014like common law jurisdictions would be.", "Barry Hughes: Yes. At this point in time, that'd be a bit of a punt.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Yes. Okay. Thank you. Janet.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the Bill will be of great significance to the Crown Prosecution Service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. So, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. What's your answer to that?", "Barry Hughes: There is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and I think probably about\u2014. There are over\u2014. From memory\u2014please never hold me to this\u2014but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. There are some offences on the statute\u2014. I've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. So, we have various defences to do with Acts. I remember seeing some about Antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there. Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant\u2014what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything\u2014that would be a nonsense\u2014or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. The criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. So, awareness is important and it comes back to that point.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. And then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise?", "Barry Hughes: No. It's a potential barrier, but I don't think it is a barrier. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and I know that the Ministry of Justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. So, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, I don't think it would be a barrier. I think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it. I've got no significant concerns, I have to say.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Well, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers, which have been fascinating and very clear and most helpful to the committee? You will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy. Thank you again for your time in coming here today. Diolch yn fawr.", "Barry Hughes: Thank you.

Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Um  Yeah , I believe  Uh , push-button , well   It makes it the thirteen  yeah . Push-buttons are  buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: So um  yeah , th this design is not um within our price model .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Um", "Industrial Designer: But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So it's c way too expensive .", "Project Manager: It's still too expensive , yeah . Um", "User Interface: But that's that's only for the buttons .", "Project Manager: I I guess if we leave the  if we leave this one out , um", "User Interface: So the button we can use plastic .", "Project Manager: oh .", "Project Manager: And uh maybe not use the special form .", "User Interface: And the pla uh  And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .", "Industrial Designer: But it", "Project Manager: It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: But it's the board decision . Um  And um  yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Well , b basically it   when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an  uh focus on another uh", "Industrial Designer: So  Type of m maybe another market segment .", "Project Manager: Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: and uh m maximise the profits", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: and um", "Industrial Designer: That's  maybe that's better .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Maybe we could uh  we should go for straight and simple ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: but that's not what uh has been asked .", "Project Manager: I know , I know .", "Industrial Designer: So we should kick the board's uh   Well", "Project Manager: Yeah . Although I think we  yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no .  It's not that innovative .", "Project Manager: Or however you s pronounce that .", "User Interface: Yeah , too bad .", "Project Manager: Um so , okay .  Um  Oh ,", "Project Manager: this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign .  We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Um  but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess", "Marketing: Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's true .", "Industrial Designer: Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .", "Project Manager: We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: Well", "Industrial Designer: Is it fancy ?", "Project Manager: I d it is it is", "Marketing: Uh", "Marketing: Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ?", "Project Manager: Yeah , I think so .", "User Interface: Um the yellow rubber , I think so .", "Industrial Designer: I think so .", "Project Manager: You like the rubber , uh Roo .", "User Interface: I'm into it .", "Marketing: So uh one ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But it's not that fancy .", "Project Manager: No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .", "Industrial Designer: I mean I think uh  I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing  the casing . It would be even more", "Project Manager: You like tita", "Industrial Designer: oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it .", "Project Manager: That's a flavour as well .", "Industrial Designer: It has flavour . Yes , that's right .  You should taste it .", "Project Manager: Right . Um", "Project Manager: Yeah , I know ,", "Marketing: Is it uh", "Project Manager: but but it  but that's fancy in the way um   I mean fancy has has a lot of", "Industrial Designer: It has to do with fashion , I guess .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: It's trendy trendy , fun", "Industrial Designer: So do", "Marketing: And w", "User Interface: yeah .", "Marketing: yeah , w what they want  wanted was uh colours and soft materials .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So in that way  It  it's fancy .", "Project Manager: It applies . It  yeah .", "User Interface: Well , just  give it a two .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "User Interface: It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but", "Industrial Designer: I think I th I think it would have been  I would have think  uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .", "User Interface: Yeah , but that's sti that's uh", "Industrial Designer: So", "User Interface: Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't  we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . So I believe uh we are close uh to two .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I I agree .", "Industrial Designer: Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did   yes , we did good .", "Marketing: Okay , and uh was it innovative ?", "Project Manager: Well ,", "Project Manager: with the voice recognition feature and uh", "User Interface: But that's not in it . Ov or can we", "Marketing: Yep .", "Project Manager: No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype .", "Industrial Designer: Well , let's let's  this product .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: And the scroll uh wheel . The solar  not many remotes have the solar , I think .", "Industrial Designer: No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too", "Marketing: Yeah , and uh", "Project Manager: That would have been a thrill .", "Industrial Designer: yes , but", "Marketing: So uh also a uh two ?", "Industrial Designer: I think uh it's a two .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Marketing: Is it easy to use ?", "Project Manager: I'm not sure .  I'm not sure .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "User Interface: Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard  it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it .", "Industrial Designer: Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .", "User Interface: I think  I think a three .", "Industrial Designer: So uh  It's maybe  it's not very uh easy for", "User Interface: Wouldn't give it more .", "Project Manager: Uh I'm doubting  doubting as well . Um", "Marketing: Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .", "Project Manager: Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I   I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: because he is already  he or she is already an advanced user .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: Um  Okay .", "Industrial Designer: After all , I think  personally I would give a two . But", "Project Manager: Uh Roo , a three ?", "User Interface: Yep .", "Project Manager: Ruud ?", "Marketing: Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten .", "Project Manager: So I could make it e easy ?", "User Interface: If you make it a four it will be three in general .", "Industrial Designer: So that's w No , two and a half .", "User Interface: If he makes it a four . Not a three .", "Industrial Designer: Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So", "User Interface: Darn . Nee .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Marketing: Hmm ? Huh ?", "Project Manager: Roo .", "User Interface: A seven , a three   No .", "Marketing: Yeah . I yeah  .", "User Interface: A four and a three together .", "Industrial Designer: Four ?", "User Interface: Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ?", "Marketing: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: Two ?", "Marketing: two , two , three", "Project Manager: No ,", "User Interface: And a three ?", "Project Manager: I haven't said anything yet .", "User Interface: Nee . I know .", "Marketing: No .", "Project Manager: Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five .", "Industrial Designer: Divided by four .", "User Interface: Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three  three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four", "Project Manager: But I'm filling in a three .", "Industrial Designer: That's not even", "Project Manager: Does it  will  so it will be a two point five .", "Industrial Designer: But that's not possible to fill in ,", "Project Manager: Yes , it is .", "Industrial Designer: so we have to round it .", "Marketing: Is it easy to find ?", "Project Manager: I have a veto .  Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about  okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely .", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "User Interface: we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .", "Industrial Designer: It it most definitely is  it's very easy .", "Project Manager: Yeah , or beeps or  yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Maybe  Uh I I think I think", "Project Manager: I'm here , I'm here .", "Industrial Designer: something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .", "User Interface: But even without it", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Well , I uh", "Industrial Designer: So , I th", "Project Manager: we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Um Sebastian ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , me too .", "User Interface: Me too .", "Marketing: Yeah , I agree .", "Project Manager: Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh", "Project Manager: it can't be more spongy . So", "Industrial Designer: Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is  um can be  uh how d how do you prono is is moldable .", "User Interface: Was it one of our options ?", "Industrial Designer: No , it's not one of our option ,", "Marketing: No . Uh", "Project Manager: No okay , but but", "User Interface: So , in the in", "Industrial Designer: but when you look in the market , when you look", "Marketing: this this was a most spongy option .", "Project Manager: for the options given , it's the most spongy one .", "Industrial Designer: Uh yes ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics  characteristics with uh market  uh with with the real market .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there .", "Project Manager: They're out there .", "User Interface: But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes , but it's not good enough ,", "Project Manager: I'll give it a one .", "Industrial Designer: so it's a two .", "User Interface: I wan I'll take one .", "Industrial Designer: You take one ? What do you give it ?", "Marketing: Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could", "Project Manager: Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number .", "Marketing: but  yeah .", "Project Manager: Because we need to go on  in  for the time .", "Marketing: Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation .", "User Interface: It will be a one .", "Marketing: So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .", "Industrial Designer: No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four .", "Project Manager: You are", "Project Manager: okay .", "Project Manager: The remote control offers enough features .", "Project Manager: Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?", "Marketing: Well , the basic layout doesn't offem  offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So", "Industrial Designer: Basically it's it's completely programmable .", "Marketing: Yeah , depends .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I know .", "Industrial Designer: So it's quite advanced .", "Project Manager: What what we didn't talk about is um uh", "User Interface: Yeah , but  it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's  If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is  it has all the features um a normal remote has .", "Project Manager: I think it has .", "Marketing: Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat", "Project Manager: Yeah . Bec because you can um  we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So ,", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um   the the signals .", "Industrial Designer: Has uh the signals sent to it .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Signal .", "Project Manager: So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to  as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features .", "Industrial Designer: Absolutely .", "Project Manager: Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . But that  that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: You can use your voice to to programme it . It's", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the  for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .", "User Interface: I'll give a two .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I'll give it a one .", "Marketing: Um I think think a one , 'cause  v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um", "Industrial Designer: Yes . I I've  I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: So high quality , low acceptance .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But  whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is  well , is not sure .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: D do you agree ?", "Industrial Designer: Yes , I agree . I", "Marketing: Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh  function .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Industrial Designer: But   Yes .", "User Interface: But we could  couldn't uh  what what's the selling price ? Fifty ?", "Project Manager: Twenty five Euros .", "User Interface: Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: But even now , if only our production costs w  uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was  were t uh was twenty two ?", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: So uh  selling price uh would be uh", "Industrial Designer: M about fifty Euros .", "User Interface: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: That's quite ex", "User Interface: That's price , but w w", "Industrial Designer: well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .", "User Interface: No . An original remote control of any TV kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh", "Industrial Designer: Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .", "User Interface: Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .", "Project Manager: Bu but  well  yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition", "Project Manager: .", "Industrial Designer: and this one does .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So I think it's worth its price .", "Project Manager: Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um", "Marketing: Yeah , but uh  with these ratings uh", "Project Manager: That's counting .", "Industrial Designer: Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .", "Marketing: should be about one point s seven ,", "User Interface: Four six seven eight .", "Marketing: yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Nine divided by six .", "Project Manager: Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um  What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ?", "Project Manager: Try to translate that .", "Industrial Designer: Well", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Any any other  Uh , Roo ?", "User Interface: Yeah , I think uh", "Industrial Designer: Well , I think", "Marketing: Ye", "Project Manager: Roo .", "User Interface: The process was good .", "User Interface: But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made", "Industrial Designer: Mm . Actually , we had", "User Interface: the the choice between  what", "Project Manager: Better decision .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "User Interface: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: We had we had too little information actually .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So  And uh um the the the  well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too  the the choice of components was way too narrow .", "Project Manager: Less . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So there was not really a process of uh", "Project Manager: So we could we we could be  we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .", "Industrial Designer: Well  Yes .", "Marketing: The prices .", "Industrial Designer: Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: We we thought of possibilities  who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . So", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: We're tempered by that , yes .", "Project Manager: Okay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ?", "User Interface: No , no .", "Project Manager: Ruud ?", "Marketing: I agree .", "Project Manager: You agree , okay . Uh leadership .", "User Interface: Fantastic .", "Project Manager: Okay , Roo's on for his promotion .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,  okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: I think we're a good team .", "Project Manager: I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment .

Um", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed .", "Project Manager: Yeah .  So um", "Project Manager: Yeah , but but si uh w w w   when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well .", "Industrial Designer: I think so too .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Um", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ?", "Industrial Designer: Uh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Because of the response", "Industrial Designer: It  it's", "Project Manager: or", "User Interface: Response", "Industrial Designer: The response is very slow", "User Interface: and", "Industrial Designer: and the possibilities are very limited .

Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings   , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this", "Marketing: And I can start if you want . Mm .", "Project Manager: sure .", "Marketing: Is there an order ? No .", "Project Manager: Hm ?", "Marketing: We haven't decided on an order .", "Project Manager: No , any any order's fine . Yeah .", "Marketing: First . Okay . Um , how do I put this", "Industrial Designer: Just uh", "Marketing: I'll just put the cable in .", "Project Manager: Oh yeah , sorry .", "Marketing: Is that it ? Can you see ?  Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ?", "Project Manager: It sh it takes a few seconds I think .", "Industrial Designer: You may need to", "User Interface: Who's that ?", "Marketing: No .", "Industrial Designer: But sometimes you have to do it", "Marketing: Is it in the right thing ?", "Industrial Designer: it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight .", "Marketing: Oh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me .", "Project Manager: Uh-huh , and then press function .", "Project Manager: and F_ eight .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Could you just plug it back into hers because she had", "Marketing: Oh , wait .", "User Interface: oh .", "Marketing: That's  is that it ?", "Industrial Designer: Adjusting .", "Project Manager: Here we are .", "Industrial Designer: The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it .", "Marketing: Right here we are .", "Project Manager: Oh . Is it on ?", "Marketing: We're here .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .", "Project Manager: Hm .", "Marketing: Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than  you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together .  And that's all I have to say about the matter ,  um .", "Project Manager: 'Kay .", "Marketing: Shall I  what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?", "Project Manager: Yeah . Just move right on .", "User Interface: Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?", "Project Manager: Uh function F_ eight .", "Marketing: Function F_ eight .", "User Interface: 'Kay . What's function ?", "Project Manager: It's the little blue  w it's the one  th", "User Interface: Oh function , I see it .", "Project Manager: yeah . Yeah should be", "User Interface: There we go .", "Project Manager: It should be  yeah .", "User Interface: Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um  just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet  .", "User Interface: And okay so basically um  I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um  so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that  like close together that um  are used in the same way , uh  or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh  can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the TV . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um  does it do  or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um   I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but  And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .  Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um  like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .  That concludes my presentation .", "User Interface: Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh .", "Industrial Designer: How do I um", "Marketing: S That's on view .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: Oh .", "Industrial Designer: Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the TV . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the TV and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the TV , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their TV or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the TV . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the TV which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the TV , that's just sort of standard , um so most TVs have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation .", "Project Manager: 'Kay .", "User Interface: Do you know about like", "Industrial Designer: Mm ?", "User Interface: I dunno , you seem like you know about", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here .", "User Interface: Okay . Cool .", "Project Manager: Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um  we have  we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so   due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um ,", "Project Manager: also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something  I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um .

Are we um should that thing be on the  thing to put the  you s you talking about a home for it .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?", "Project Manager: We probably leave that .

Yeah , for sure .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can  I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take  like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the TV .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Well for sure we need the um  I think we can just design the channels ?

So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just", "Marketing: Oh okay , yeah .", "User Interface: It seems like that would be hard though .", "Project Manager: But", "User Interface: I mean , like because unless you know", "Project Manager: It might be confusing . Yeah .", "User Interface: yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't  I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Besides you like to be able to go power .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I never think to hold something down .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: I have the power", "User Interface: Yeah . B  Yeah .", "Project Manager: I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Well even um iPod thing   , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of", "User Interface: That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .", "Marketing: scrolling  I don't know .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: Yeah . Because people li seem  now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no  Know you don't have one two three four five", "User Interface: Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool ,", "Project Manager: Mm .", "User Interface: it's it's funny like you f like I just  I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and  it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah yeah , it's just  and it's one thing which has everything .", "User Interface: Yeah , and it is  yeah . It is really  but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?", "Marketing: Well can't it tell the  like can't you  if you", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .", "User Interface: Yeah . Okay .", "Marketing: you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .", "Project Manager: Oh that's gonna  Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of", "User Interface: Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like  it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad .", "Project Manager: okay . I've never used one . No .", "Marketing: It's like l this  like that , and then you do that .", "Project Manager: Okay . Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah and then .", "Marketing: And then you can have um   if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing  like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .", "User Interface: Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that  Or it  oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can", "Marketing: Yeah , you can", "Project Manager: Well i", "User Interface: zap .", "Marketing: Yeah , click o actually click on to have", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom  So do you need to", "Industrial Designer: Doesn't it rotate though ,", "User Interface: okay .", "Industrial Designer: so it'll be moving around .", "User Interface: Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like", "Marketing: What do you mean the function ?", "User Interface: I mean like okay , 'cause so  I dunno , I guess  Okay  so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise .

That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .", "Industrial Designer: Oh .", "Project Manager: So it's like holding", "Marketing: And then  well if you do that it goes , but if you  like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen .", "Project Manager: You can  o And you you  is there an extra actual button ?

Mm-hmm . Right .

Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: S", "User Interface: Yeah .

Why don't you start with that ?

And um , uh , we ordered uh , SUN - Blade - one - hundreds , and um , I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running  So the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um ,  run things using P - make and Customs . You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that . The simplest thing  And I can send an email around or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something . Um ,", "Professor C: How about an email that points to the FAQ ,", "PhD F: there 's a c", "Professor C: you know what I 'm saying ?", "PhD F: Yeah , yeah .", "Professor C: so that you can  Yeah .", "PhD F: Uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called \" run command \" . \" Run dash command \" , \" run hyphen command \" . And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh  and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . So you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command . So you can say \" run dash command L S \" , and , um , it 'll actually export that  LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , and um  And that 's a simple way to get started using  using this . And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up ,  um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it . Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . So . You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . So , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're  Uh .

Um ,", "Grad G: OK .", "PhD F: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . Um .

So that seems to be giving  uh , improving over their uh , system . Slightly . But , not very significantly . And uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over  final  by plugging in an LDA . And uh , so then after  after that I  I added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that .

That 's all I found So I have to . Uh , Yeah . And uh , uh , the other  other thing what I tried was , I just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the Aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the  I mean the w speech and nonspeech .

So , um , the idea is you have all these  these different events , for example voicing , nasality , R - coloring , you know burst or noise , uh , frication , that kinda stuff , um , building robust um , primary detectors for these acoustic events , and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition . Um , and , um , these  these primary detectors , um , will be , uh , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , um , doing things , um , similar to Larry Saul 's work on , uh , graphical models to  to detect these  these , uh , acoustic events . And , um , so I  I been  I been thinking about that and some of the issues that I 've been running into are , um , exactly what  what kind of acoustic events I need , what  um , what acoustic events will provide a  a good enough coverage to  in order to do the later recognition steps . And , also , um , once I decide a set of acoustic events , um , h how do I  how do I get labels ? Training data for  for these acoustic events . And , then later on down the line , I can start playing with the  the models themselves , the  the primary detectors . Um , so , um , I kinda see  like , after  after building the primary detectors I see um , myself taking the outputs and feeding them in , sorta tandem style into  into a um , Gaussian mixtures HMM back - end , um , and doing recognition . Um .

Um , well , so , I was helping a speech researcher named Pierre Divenyi and he 's int He wanted to um , look at um , how people respond to formant changes , I think . Um . So he  he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel - to - vowel transitions , and then he wanted a psycho - acoustic um , spectrum .

Actually it  This  this maybe brings up another topic which is um  So we 're done with that topic .

I think the uh  Were  were you basically done with the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh  bleep editing .", "Grad C: Right . So the  The idea is that we need to have  We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece  pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password ,", "Professor E: Yeah .", "Grad C: a single password . Each person will have a single password , user name and password . And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . And that way each person only has to remember one password .", "Professor E: I  I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . I mean if people have  Uh , I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . And then  um  if I thought it was OK , I 'd say \" it 's OK \" .", "Grad C: Mm - hmm .", "Professor E: And , I  uh  I mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare .", "Grad C: Right , I mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for  other reasons .", "Professor E: OK .", "Grad C: And so that  that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people  you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um  I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just uh , tell them , \" here 's the web page \" , um , \" you need a password \" . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it .", "Professor E: That 's  I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say  \" here is a  here is  \" I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but  but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , \" here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK \" .", "Grad C: I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide .", "Professor E: And then they 'd hand it back to you .", "Grad C: But certainly I wouldn't want a printout .

I mean , it", "Grad C: Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I  I 'm  I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these .

So .", "Professor E: Really ?", "Postdoc F: I have one question . So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ?

OK there 's  I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor E: OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh \" well , yeah , I really would like to see that . \" And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document , I mean unless you 're searching . Searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not  so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that ,", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor E: but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . Um if  if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out . I mean , so it 's  it 's  I mean , you  you 're  you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where  where I  I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go \" hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , \" and then that group would need it  S It seems like i if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case .

I guess an email OK is alright .", "Grad C: Oh that was another thing I  I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it  that an email approval was sufficient . But  I don't actually know .", "PhD B: Are  are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ?", "Grad C: Yes . If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I  I  I think they should be allowed to do that .", "Postdoc F: I also  mm - hmm .", "PhD B: So that means other people are editing what you say ?", "Professor E: Uh  I don't know about that .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "PhD B: I don't know if I like that .", "Grad C: Well , the only other choice is that the person would say \" no , don't distribute this meeting at all \" , and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say \" don't distribute it at all \" .", "Professor E: But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice .", "Grad C: Well , but if  if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient .", "Professor E: Right ? Yeah . Yeah , but that 's our decision then . Right ?", "Grad C: Um , I don't think so . I mean , because if I object to the conversation .", "Professor E: I think it is .", "Grad C: If I say \" we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , \" and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side .", "Postdoc F: The  I agree that the consent forms were  uh , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that  um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them .", "Professor E: I see . OK , well , if that 's what it said .", "Postdoc F: And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that  uh , we wouldn't want someone to say \" oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but  it was too hard to access \" .

So it could that the burden would come back onto us . So I 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint .", "Professor E: Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think ,", "Postdoc F: Yeah .", "Grad C: It seems to me that sending them email , saying \" if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK ,", "Professor E: because  Uh - huh .", "Grad C: If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password \" , seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise .

OK .", "Grad E: And it 's so simple even I can use it .", "Grad A: Wow , that is simple .", "Grad E: OK , so here was OK , I can think of uh people being cheap , average , or spendy or we can even have a  a finer scale moderately cheap ,", "Professor B: Doesn't matter .", "Grad E: doesn't matter .

So here 's  here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gonna have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ?

Right .", "Grad E: more likely to view if he 's a tourist um and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um", "Professor B: We did , but the three things w that  that it contributed to this in fact , the other two aren't up there . so one was the ontology", "Grad E: We 'll d what type of building is it ?", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: And the  and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse .", "Grad E: What he has mentioned before .", "Professor B: OK , so this is w Right , so what w I  what we seem to need here , this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff", "Grad A: mm - hmm", "Professor B: the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . So each of those the way we had it designed , now we can change the design , but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations", "Grad A: mm - hmm", "Professor B: so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes", "Grad E: Uh we can load it up it you know very simple .", "Grad A: So", "Professor B: and then what you and I have to talk about is , OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ? But the  they 're  they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about .", "Grad E: So this was adjusted for this one mode thing .", "Grad D: Oh yes .", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad E: So that 's w w in our uh in  in Johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something .", "Professor B: Oh , it was called mode , so this  this is m mode here means the same as endpoint .", "Grad E: Is now this endpoint .", "Grad C: Right .", "Professor B: OK , why don't we ch can we change that ?", "Grad E: We can just rename that , yeah .", "Professor B: Alright . You know , but that was actually , yeah unfortunately that was a um kind of an intermediate versio that 's I don't think what we would currently do .", "Grad A: Can I ask about \" slurred \" and \" angry \" as inputs to this ?", "Professor B: That 's a", "Grad A: What  why ?", "Grad D: Like they 're either true or false", "Grad E: The prosody ?", "Grad A: OK .", "Grad D: and they uh oh I see .", "Grad C: If the  if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK . Drunk .", "Grad D: Therefore", "Grad C: And , you know , possibly uh", "Grad A: Less likely to enter .", "Grad C: some ,", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Grad C: yeah .", "Grad D: uh I was thinking less likely to view", "Professor B: Yeah . But that 's - that seems to , yeah . So  so my advice to do is  is get this down to what we think is actually likely to  to be a  a strong influence .", "Grad A: OK .", "Professor B: But yeah , that was what he had in mind .", "Grad D: Right .", "Professor B: So let 's think about this  this question of how do we wanna handle  so there 're two separate things . One is  uh at least two . One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that I think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . So the  let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing , the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: OK , et cetera . So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set , so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: Now", "Grad E: Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in  in  in some of the other final decisions done here , for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um", "Professor B: Right . Right .", "Grad E: if it 's exhibiting itself it is a landmark ,", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad E: meaning more likely to be viewed", "Professor B: Yep .", "Grad E: if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this , then it 's more likely to be entered .", "Professor B: I uh that 's  I think that 's completely right and um I think that 's good , right ? So what  what that says is that we might be able to uh take and in particular so  so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling", "Grad E: Accessibility .", "Professor B: no , accessibility meant", "Grad E: If it 's closed one probably won't enter . Or if it 's not accessible to a tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it ,", "Professor B: OK .", "Grad E: given that he knows it , of course .", "Professor B: Alright . So let me suggest this . Uh w could you move those up about halfway . Uh The ones that you th And selling I guess .", "Grad E: Yeah , all  all of these if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things", "Professor B: Right . So here  here 's what it looks like to me . is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of  of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . So that it uh that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other . Does that seem right ? So we di", "Grad C: Basic you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ?", "Professor B: if we Yes .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: So if  well it may be more than endpoint decisions , so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three", "Grad E: These three ?", "Professor B: Yeah . Eh ser s uh selling , fixing , and servicing .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad D: What ex um and so either those is true f or false ?", "Professor B: Uh Uh well it  it  i here 's where it gets a little tricky .", "Grad D: So", "Professor B: Uh from the belief - net point of view it is from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's  it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth .", "Grad A: Yeah .", "Professor B: So for this decision it 's just uh true or false", "Grad D: OK . Yeah .", "Professor B: and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want .", "Grad D: OK .", "Professor B: That  that if any of those things is true then it 's the kind of place that you uh", "Grad E: Um more likely to enter .", "Professor B: are more likely to enter .", "Grad D: So you just wanna have them all pointing to a summary thing ?", "Professor B: You could , yeah . Yeah , so let 's do that . No no , no eh to  to an inter no , an intermediate node .", "Grad D: T", "Grad E: Oh , OK .", "Professor B: That 's the p part of the idea , is", "Grad E: Um is  is that the object type node ?", "Professor B: I d", "Grad E: So are they the  is it the kind of object that sells , fixes , or services things ?", "Professor B: Well , o open up object type and let 's see what its values are .", "Grad E: Oh I just created it , it has none so far .", "Professor B: Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects , we called them entities , right ?", "Grad E: Yeah .

Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business .", "Grad C: OK .", "Grad D: Um what does the underscore - T at the end of each of those things signify ?", "Grad E: Um things .

That also points to entity type I guess .", "Grad A: So we 're deriving um this  the  this feature of whether the  the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ?

Yeah . N", "Grad D: Like situation traffic and so on .", "Grad A: Yeah , the time of day .", "Professor B: Yeah . Yeah .

Uh what 's  what 's another decision you like ?", "Grad E: OK , these have no parents yet , but I guess that sort of doesn't matter . Right ?", "Professor B: Well , the idea is that you go there , you go comes from something about the user from something about the situation and the uh the discourse is  is a mystery .", "Grad E: I mean this is sort of This comes from traffic and so forth , yeah .

And if he has seen it already or not and so forth ,", "Professor B: Right .", "Grad E: OK . Um and discourse is something that sort of should we make a Keith note here ?", "Professor B: Sure .", "Grad E: That sort of comes from Keith .", "Professor B: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: Just sort of so we don't forget . Oops . Have to get used to this . OK , whoops .", "Grad A: Um actually", "Professor B: And then also the discourse endpoint , I  I guess endpoint sub - D is  if you wanna make it consistent .", "Grad C: Wh - ah .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: Um actually is this the  the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because isn't the , I mean", "Professor B: I think so . S", "Grad A: uh , hmm OK . But that still allows for the possibility of the  of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from", "Professor B: Maybe not , a Right .", "Grad A: That  all that  that kind of decision making happens at the Go - there node .", "Professor B: Uh y you  yeah you  i you  if you needed to do that .", "Grad A: Uh . If you needed it to do that .", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad A: But uh OK I was just thinking I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible  possible asking of the user", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad A: you know hey there 's a strike on , uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something", "Professor B: Ah . Good point , I don't  I don't know how we 're going to  t uh", "Grad A: or Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model but , you know , directly out of interaction .", "Professor B: Right . Uh I gu yes my curr you know , don't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: Uh My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things", "Grad A: OK .", "Professor B: you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ?", "Grad A: Yeah .", "Professor B: But uh if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ?", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK .", "Professor B: But I think trying to formulate the conditional question , that sounds too much .", "Grad A: Right , right . Yeah . Right , sure , OK .", "Professor B: To me .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: Alright , but let me  let  let 's stay with this a minute", "Grad E: But", "Professor B: because I want to do a little bit of organization . Before we get more into details . The organization is going to be that uh the flavor of what 's going on is going to be that uh as we s e sort of going to this detail indeed Keith is going to  to worry about the various constructions that people might use", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: and Johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard ,", "Grad A: Alright .", "Professor B: so what 's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates , OK uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . I j wa I  I assume everybody knows that , I just wanna you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then ,", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: so the semantics that you 'll get out of the discourse will be of values that go into the various discourse - based decision nodes . And now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff so it isn't by any means uh necessarily a simple thing that you want out . So uh if there is an and there is mode of transportation", "Grad E: And it there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said what 's the utterance go giving us", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad E: and then what 's the discourse history give us .", "Professor B: Yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide uh how much of th where that goes .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: That 's uh two things then .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: Mmm .", "Professor B: an and it 's not clear yet . I mean it could be those are two separate things , it could be that the discourse gadget itself integrates em as  which would be my guess that you 'd have to do see in order to do reference and stuff like that um you 've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say I wanna go back there ,", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: wow , what does that mean and uh", "Grad E: Mm - hmm", "Grad A: Now . Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: Alright .

S so we 're  we 're gonna have to use some t care in the knowledge engineering to not have this explode . And in fact I think it doesn't in the sense that um Read it , you know actually with the underlying semantics and stuff I think it isn't like you have two hundred and fifty - six different uh ways of  of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some place . Alright . So we  we just have to figure out what the regularities are and and code them .

Yeah , I  I mean , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes .", "Professor B: Right . Yeah , and Um I  that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into , but um we have to know what we want first . OK , so why don't you tell us a little bit about decision nodes and what  what the choices might be for these ?", "Grad D: So Ah , sorry . I guess that 's", "Grad C: You can technically wear that as you 're talking .", "Grad D: Yeah , it 's right , I guess I can do that .", "Grad A: Darn .", "Professor B: Put it in your , yeah .", "Grad D: I guess this board works fine . So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . Right ? So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down . So what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set , right ? These are all like saying EV or A , right ? So it 's not just a generalized situation like I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of  we wanna view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wanna sort of combine their decisions and create you know , um sorta weighted combination .", "Grad E: Hmm . ROVER , the ROVER decision .", "Grad D: The what decision ?", "Grad E: ROVER . All of their outputs combined to make a decision .", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Grad D: Yeah . Yeah . So the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those , right ? That 's the way belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ? So um that 's what we want , we want for example P of um let 's call this guy Y and let 's call these X - one , X - two XN , right . So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example um E given that these guys are I 'll just refer to this as like X um hat or something , uh the co like all of them ? Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something right ?", "Professor B: Yep .", "Grad D: So we would like to do this kind of combination .", "Professor B: Alright , so um Is that uh I  yeah , I just wanna make sure everybody is with us before he goes on .", "Grad A: I think so , yeah .", "Professor B: It 's  it 's cl e is  is it clear what he wants to compute ?", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: Right . So , right . So Basically um  what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E , s give a number", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: because that 's obviously not desirable . What we wanna do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to um add up to one , right ?", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Grad D: So those are the two things that we uh need . So what uh I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages , right ? So for example here two people have voted for A , one has voted for V , and one has voted for E , so we could say that the probabilities are , you know , probability of being E is one over four , because one person voted for E out of four and similarly , probability of so this is probability of E s and then probability of A given all that is um two out of four and probability of V is one out of four . Right ? So that 's step  that 's the uh yeah that 's the  that 's the basic uh thing . Now", "Grad E: Um Yeah .", "Grad D: Is that all OK ?", "Grad E: And that one outcome , that 's", "Professor B: What ?", "Grad E: it 's X  X - one voted for A X - two voted for V", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: and so forth ?", "Professor B: Y right . Yep .", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which may or may not be a good assumption ,", "Grad E: That 's the outcome .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . Right .", "Professor B: so that", "Grad D: Yeah . Yeah . So step two is um right . So we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh", "Grad C: X - one matters more i than X - two or", "Grad D: Right . Sure , so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth so we could replace this by uh W - one , W - two , W - three , and W - four", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Grad D: right ? And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each um X - hat , we just need that the W 's sum to one . So they can be for example , you know you  you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say .", "Grad E: That 's one .", "Grad D: And that 'd be one . So that um also seems to work fine . And uh", "Grad C: So I jus just to make sure I understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ?", "Grad D: You 'd compute the weighted average , so the probability of E would be uh", "Grad C: OK , so  so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be uh  W one times", "Grad A: Point three .", "Grad C: or A or  let 's see , one full quarter times point one", "Grad D: Not one quarter ,", "Grad A: No .", "Grad D: so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . So you can view these as gone .", "Grad C: OK .", "Grad D: Probability of", "Grad C: OK .", "Grad D: Yeah . Yeah . OK . So , alright . So this is uh step two . So the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert , right , whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called \" H \" , OK ? This is a hidden variable . And what this is is it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four , and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . Right ? And then these guys all come here . OK . So this is sightly uh more complicated . So what 's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . So H produces some you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ? Now this guy he looks at the value of H say it 's two , and then he just selects the uh thing . That 's all there is to say , I guess about it . Right , so you can have a mixture that", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: Right .", "Grad A: So  so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs . It 's driving how the other four are interpreted . OK .", "Grad D: Yeah . Yeah .", "Grad C: So H passes a vector on to the next node ?", "Grad D: It could .", "Grad C: It could ? A vector of the weights as the se", "Grad D: Yeah , it could", "Grad C: oh .", "Grad D: Sorry ?", "Grad A: Well a vector with three zero 's and one one , right ?", "Grad C: Oh it 's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in or which one of the weighting systems", "Grad D: Right , so I mean the way you desc", "Grad C: W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , couldn't you ? OK .", "Grad A: Um Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the  that 's determined by what the experts are saying , like the type of situ OK . Hmm . OK . OK . I mean It  it just seems that like without that  that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if  if uh X - one says no , you know , a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , you know , I mean that seems like that 'd be weird ,", "Grad D: Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also .", "Grad A: right ? Oh , OK . OK . Alright , right .", "Grad C: Oh The situations that H has , are they built into the net or OK , so they  they could either be hand coded or learned or OK .", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Grad C: Based on training data , OK .", "Grad D: Yeah . Yes .", "Grad C: So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . Oh yeah .", "Grad D: Yeah . Um Well , I mean to learn them we need data , where are we gonna get data ? Well I mean we need data with people intentions , right ?", "Grad A: Right , right .", "Grad D: Which is slightly tricky . Right .", "Grad A: Uh - huh .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm . But what 's the data about like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ?", "Grad A: Like how thrifty the user is , or do we have access to that ? Mm - hmm . Oh right . Oh good . OK .", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK .", "Grad D: Yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we  I mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - E , or endpoint sub uh  you know s S ?", "Grad C: Well , basically you would say , based on  in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was ,", "Grad D: Mmm . Mmm .", "Grad C: right ?", "Grad D: So this is what we wanna learn . Yep . Right . Hmm . Yeah . I don't think , well you have a  can you bring up the function thing ? Um w where is the thing that allows you to sort of", "Grad C: That 's on the added variable , isn't it ?", "Grad D: Oh function properties , is that it ? Hmm , I guess not . Yeah , that 's", "Grad A: No .", "Grad D: Right . OK . And um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which I think is unlikely , I think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such CPU 's on your own in the java base format . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because yeah I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's Right . Yeah .", "Grad C: Ah . Well in terms of java base I think it 's basically what you see is what you get in I don't yeah , I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here .", "Grad A: So Yeah . Yeah . By the way um uh just talking about uh about that general end of things uh is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they 're interacting with the system and so on ? Like , I mean , what kind of questions are being given  being asked ? Cuz  OK . Yeah yeah . OK . OK . Fey , you mean . OK . OK . O OK . OK . I 'm just wondering , because in terms of , you know , I mean uh w the figure  I was thinking about this figure that we talked about , fifty constructions or whatever that 's uh that 's a whole lot of constructions and um you know , I mean one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer so , I mean I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . OK . I mean , I  I  I  I was  uh I was talking about the , you know , if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know which fifty do I do , I wanna see what people are using , so Well , it will inspire me .

The cost", "Marketing: Twelve , twelve a half .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think for the cost we want  for the cost we want   it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .", "Marketing: That might just  So .", "Industrial Designer: You can go to the next slide .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: I have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .", "Project Manager: What is this ?", "Industrial Designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and  .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So and the next slide , it is the last one it's  So it's  I think it should be wire  wireless re remote con  Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?", "Marketing: What's the average price of this technology then ?", "Industrial Designer: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the", "User Interface: So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire  with remote control ?", "Industrial Designer: You'd  yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: So you think that uh  a cable between the remote control  and the TV   won't be a good idea .", "User Interface: Okay . Okay .", "Project Manager: No it wou maybe it will be cheaper  I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu", "Marketing: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a", "Project Manager: Yeah ,", "User Interface: Wireless remote control  .", "Project Manager: but", "Marketing: I don't think  well , yeah , I don't think he would ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,", "Marketing: but in a sense", "Industrial Designer: sometime I want to have wire because you know .", "Project Manager: Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?", "Project Manager: I'm just asking you .

True .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah .", "Project Manager: I think it's more your problem .

That's the", "Project Manager: Okay ,  I'm sorry .", "Marketing: Now the", "Project Manager: So", "Industrial Designer: Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because  even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the  the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use ,  so  it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .", "Project Manager: So", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: just think of um the usability .", "User Interface: Design a wireless remote control .", "Project Manager: Yeah .

We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's", "Project Manager: You mean the loo the look , the outside ?", "Industrial Designer: The look , how it look like .", "Marketing: Yeah , the the look is is bad for them", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so  doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay .

Uh , so as you said uh ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .", "Marketing: So this is from the experiments we've done ,", "Marketing: so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .

And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .", "Project Manager: What is R_S_I_ ?", "Marketing: R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um  doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Ah um okay .", "Marketing: Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide .

Welcome to the 20thmeeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a reminder to all members, in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not be connected to the video conference. I want to remind those who are participating by video conference that, when they talk, they must use the channel that corresponds to the language they are speaking in. As usual, please direct your remarks through the chair. We are moving on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on. We will now move on to document submissions. The honourable minister, Mr. Blair.", "Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness): Mr. Chair, today I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 2019 annual report on the RCMPs use of the law enforcement justification provisions. This report addresses the RCMP's use of specified provisions within the law enforcement justification regime, which is set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the Criminal Code. This report also documents the nature of the investigations in which these provisions were used.", "The Chair: On tabling of documents, we have Minister Sajjan.", "Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence): Mr. Chair, pursuant to Standing Order 32, I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 2018-19 progress report on Canada's national action plan for the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security.", "The Chair: Now we'll go to presenting petitions. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of a special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Members who are participating in the meeting in person are kindly asked to bring the signed certificate to the office once the petition has been presented. Presenting petitions, Ms. May.", "Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, I rise to present two petitions. They both pertain to the protection of our natural world. One is an e-petition, and it relates to the threat to pollinators globally. We know that honey bees and other pollinators are essential to food production. The petitioners note that research from around the world points to a threat to pollinators, particularly from a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids. The European Union has taken action on this. The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to practise a precautionary principle and remove from use neonicotinoids in Canada to protect our pollinators. The second petition relates to the ongoing threat to the southern resident killer whales. These iconic whales are much beloved in SaanichGulf Islands, throughout coastal British Columbia and indeed across Canada. The petitioners are calling for more action to be taken as the population of southern resident killer whales continues to decline, more action for boat-free safety zones, more prohibitions around whale tourism to make sure that the whales are safe from those who are keen to watch them from too close a distance, and more of a credible enforcement regime to support these measures to keep the southern resident killer whale population in our waters and not on the list of species that have become extinct.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Genuis.", "Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Mr. Chair, for over 10 years, members of Parliament from various parties have been trying to pass legislation to deal with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. Irwin Cotler, Borys Wrzesnewskyj, Senator Salma Ataullahjan and I have all proposed bills on this. The petitioners want the House to support Bill S-204. This is another bill that would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. I'm sure petitioners would want me to add that, given the urgency of this issue, perhaps the government could consider bringing forward a government bill on this issue, which would allow the process to move much faster.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Cannings.", "Mr. Richard Cannings (South OkanaganWest Kootenay, NDP): Mr. Chair, I rise here today to present a petition from Canadian citizens in support of motion M-1, which was placed in this House by my colleague the member for New WestminsterBurnaby on the green new deal. These citizens point out that climate change has escalated into a global climate emergency and that Canada must act with ambition and urgency. They call on the government to support M-1, a made in Canada green new deal, to take bold and rapid action to adopt socially equitable climate action to tackle the climate emergency and address worsening socio-economic and racial inequalities at the same time while ending fossil fuel subsidies, closing offshore tax havens, and supporting workers impacted by the transition by creating well-paying, unionized jobs in the shift to a clean and renewable energy economy.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Johns.", "Mr. Gord Johns (CourtenayAlberni, NDP): Mr. Chair, it's an honour and privilege to table e-petition 2577, which was sponsored by Chris Alemany from Port Alberni and is supported by 5,183 petitioners. They're calling on the Government of Canada to work urgently across party lines and in partnership with provincial and territorial governments to implement a guaranteed, consistent, national and livable universal basic income system for all Canadians. The petition is very timely, coming almost one year to the day since the completion of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which also called on the government to establish a guaranteed annual livable income for all Canadians. Whether it's about providing a safety net to get through a global pandemic, the means to keep your children out of poverty at any time, or simply being able to afford safe housing or transportation, it's time for Canada to have this conversation.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Manly.", "Mr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Mr. Chair, it's an honour and a privilege to present a petition on behalf of the constituents of NanaimoLadysmith. People are concerned about gas fracking and the use of methane and the destruction that methane causes to our atmosphere and with climate change. They're calling on the government to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on the Wet'suwet'en territory, and by ordering the RCMP to dismantle their exclusion zone and to stand down. They also call on the government to schedule nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentswhich is something that we're happy to see has been happening and I commend the government for that effortand to prioritize the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.", "The Chair: Next is Mr. Lamoureux.", "Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.): Mr. Chair, like Canada, Guyana is part of the Commonwealth, and many constituents of Winnipeg North have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in March, when it was being called into question. There have been some very positive indications in recent days, but the petitioners are asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to be aware of what's taking place in Guyana, and as much as possible, to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we're being diligent in supporting what the people of Guyana want to see.", "The Chair: I just want to remind the honourable members, when presenting petitions, to be as concise as possible. I notice they're starting to stretch a bit and it's something we all tend to do. Now we'll go to Statements by Members. The first statement will be from Mr. Lefebvre.", "Mr. Paul Lefebvre (Sudbury, Lib.): Mr. Chair, I just want to say thank you to the industrious people of Sudbury who have risen to the challenge and joined forces in the face of COVID-19. I am proud of all my constituents, and all Canadians, including first responders, volunteers, health care and essential workers, local miners, the farmers and produce growers who are feeding our families, and local businesses who are staying connected with their staff. I also salute all our homegrown innovations such as ProStitch and King Sportswear face masks; Crosscut Distillery hand sanitizer; Nobel Prize winner SNOLAB's work on ventilators, which earned a federal contract; Vale Canada's $1 million in seed capital to small firms developing COVID-19 health solutions; and many more.  We are all in the same boat, but we will get out of it together.", "The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Dalton.", "Mr. Marc Dalton (Pitt MeadowsMaple Ridge, CPC): Mr. Chair, Pitt Meadows is one of Canada's most beautiful communities. It's tucked in between the Fraser and Pitt rivers and is in the shadow of Golden Ears mountain. Most of the area consists of farmland, golf courses, parks and conservation areas. It also has Pitt Lake, which is among the largest freshwater tidal lakes in the world. Pitt Meadows' history dates back thousands of years with Katzie First Nation. In the 1900s Dutch immigrants drained and diked the marshes allowing for today's bumper crops of cranberries and blueberries. It's hard to believe that this community is only a short commute to Vancouver and has one of the nation's busiest general aviation airports. Last weekend the community came together to celebrate Pitt Meadows Day a little differently because of COVID. In a great show of community spirit, from their front yards and balconies, thousands of residents came out to cheer for first responders and essential workers as we paraded throughout the city. I am thankful to have raised my family here, taught in the schools and to now be the member of Parliament representing this wonderful community.", "The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Kelloway.", "Mr. Mike Kelloway (Cape BretonCanso, Lib.): Mr. Chair, over the last few months I have watched constituents in my riding come together to look out for one another during these challenging times. Regardless of how deep and painful this pandemic has been, it continues to amaze me just how brightly the collective character of Cape BretonCanso shines through. Whether it is someone like Glen Muise, who delivers iPads to seniors' homes so they can connect with loved ones, teachers who deliver meals to students in need, Liam and Lucus Sakalauskas, two young boys who keep youth informed across the east coast, or Rose Fitzgerald, who delivered bouquets made from the remaining flowers from her shop to essential workers across her county, constituents in Cape BretonCanso have stepped up to support their community and to support those in need. Mr. Chair, as you know it is with great pride that I represent my constituents in Cape BretonCanso. The people in Cape Breton and northeastern Nova Scotia care deeply about one another. They know that as a community, we're only as strong as our most vulnerable people, and I cannot help but be filled with joy when I see these gestures happening across my riding. Thanks so much.", "The Chair: Ms. Brub, go ahead.", "Ms. Sylvie Brub (AbitibiBaie-JamesNunavikEeyou, BQ): Mr.Chair, unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member Romeo Saganash, whose commitment I commend, to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the Viens commission in Quebec. The Bloc is open to the idea, but we shouldn't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action. There are already potential solutions for taking action. Commissions have been issuing reports for decades, and Ottawa has been tabling them. Last year alone, the Viens report and the report stemming from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls contained dozens of recommendations. The federal government must work with indigenous peoples, Quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces. Civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the RCMP. Police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures. Hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation. Let's take action.", "The Chair: I give the floor to Mr.MacKinnon.", "Mr. Steven MacKinnon (Gatineau, Lib.): Mr.Chair, on behalf of myself and my parliamentary colleagues, I want to congratulate students from our high school class of 2020. We know that, owing to the pandemic, graduation celebrations will be different this year, as students will be deprived of their prom, their graduation ceremony and, in some cases, their goodbyes to friends and teachers. I know how disappointed students from the high schools of duVersant, LeCarrefour, Nicolas-Gatineau, de l'rablire, Collge Saint-Alexandre, Collge Nouvelles Frontires, Collge Saint-Joseph, Philemon-Wright and other regional schools, are not to be able to celebrate their five years of incredible efforts surrounded by their families and friends who were by their side on a daily basis. However, that takes nothing away from their accomplishment. So when they receive their diploma, here is what I will say to them: Surge ahead! The future belongs to you. Be ambitious, follow your dreams and, most importantly, continue to change the Outaouais and the world! The class of 2020 will be remembered for a long time.", "The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Morantz.", "Mr. Marty Morantz (CharleswoodSt. JamesAssiniboiaHeadingley, CPC): Mr. Chair, I am delighted to rise to talk about the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre, which is now under construction in my riding in Winnipeg. This state-of-the-art addictions recovery facility was made into a reality by Scott, Anne and Darcy Oake in memory of their son and brother Bruce, who passed away tragically from an accidental overdose in 2011. The Bruce Oake Recovery Centre will provide help to thousands of Manitobans to manage their addiction and reintegrate into the community. I was proud to support this project when I voted for it during my time on Winnipeg City Council. The addictions crisis in Canada needs action. With approximately eight million Canadians suffering from addictions, we need centres like these to help them recover so that no other family will face a heartbreaking loss due to addiction. I want to congratulate the Oakes for their commitment to making recovery for many a reality. Addictions affect us all, and we all have a part to play in contributing to the solution.", "The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Jowhari.", "Mr. Majid Jowhari (Richmond Hill, Lib.): Mr. Chair, I would like to recognize the compassion and generosity demonstrated in my riding of Richmond Hill. Week after week residents and organizations have come together to support our most vulnerable during a time of great difficulty. I want to thank the champions of the community who were generous enough to donate masks and other supplies as well as services. I would also like to recognize the charities and care centres which, upon receiving these donations, redoubled their efforts to serve their communities. Special thanks go to the Mon Sheong Foundation Long-Term Care Centre, Divine Favour Senior Homecare, the Community & Home Assistance to Seniors, the True Compassion Home Health centre, Blue Door, the Mosaic Interfaith Out of the Cold program, Yellow Brick House, Hill House Hospice, Community Living York South, and Parya Trillium Foundation for continuing to support the residents in my riding of Richmond Hill. The compassionate generosity demonstrated by these donors and organizations makes me proud to represent my community in Parliament.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Madam Lalonde.", "Mrs. Marie-France Lalonde (Orlans, Lib.): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Usually, at this time of the year, I have the pleasure of being invited to the graduation ceremony of the grade12 students in Orlans. However, we will all have to adapt to a new reality this year. I cannot express enough how, in these exceptional times, I have witnessed the strength, resilience and community spirit of our graduates. I also know that a number of high schools have made significant efforts to celebrate the success of their graduating class. Young graduate Maryanne Collard was amazed to see that people from her school, the cole secondaire catholique Batrice-Desloges, had installed a sign in her garden to congratulate her on her academic success.  As we move forward we must not forget that youth in this country are our future. We have a responsibility to be there for them and to believe in them. We will not fail.  I thank the teachers, the support staff and school management who are continuing to do their work. Congratulations to all graduates of 2020.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Vis.", "Mr. Brad Vis (MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, CPC): Mr. Chair, COVID-19 has changed and challenged how we go about our daily lives. For many this includes a shift to working from home or attending school remotely. The sad reality is that even before the crisis hit, most rural Canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable Internet connection, even though Internet is an essential service. Those in underserved areas, including many parts of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, cannot work from home and their children cannot keep up with their classmates. For many of my indigenous constituents, Internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies don't want to serve them. I, along with my colleagues, launched community consultations to address this critical issue and provide solutions. We call on the government to outline and implement a concrete action plan to address Internet connectivity deficits between rural and urban Canada. This is an issue I will continue to press on until results are achieved.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. McLeod.", "Mr. Michael McLeod (Northwest Territories, Lib.): Mr. Chair, Canada has been awarded its first-ever Equator Prize from the United Nations Development Programme. Congratulations go to Lutsl K' Dene First Nation and the Northwest Territory Mtis Nation, with support from Deninu K'ue First Nation and the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, for the establishment of the Thaidene Nn territorial protected area. It's 14,000 square kilometres of the most beautiful land and waters you'll find anywhere on earth. I would also like to thank the previous minister of the environment for securing Canada's $7.9-million commitment, along with our visit to celebrate the new park last year. The award is given to groups that have exemplified actions to protect critical ecosystems and biodiversity for generations to come and to show how indigenous peoples and local communities have confronted legacies of disadvantage and discrimination in support of their communities and the world at large. Congratulations to Lutsl K'.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Falk.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk (BattlefordsLloydminster, CPC): Mr. Chair, the Liberal government has tabled $87 billion in spending and allocated just four hours for Parliament to study, debate and pass it. The allocated time is wholly inadequate. Canadians deserve to know how that money is being spent. They deserve to know that this government spending was scrutinized and passed through the rigours of Parliament. It is Canadian taxpayers of today and tomorrow who will have the responsibility to pay for this government's spending. It is Canadian workers and businesses who will have to do the hard work of rebuilding our economy. It is real Canadians who fall through the cracks when this Liberal government's programs fail to meet their intended goals. A rubber stamp under the guise of health and safety is not democracy. Canadians are owed better. Just as we gather four days a week for a hybrid committee meeting, parliamentarians can gather to do the full scope of the work that Canadians elected us to do.", "The Chair: We now go to Mr. Godin.", "Mr. Jol Godin (PortneufJacques-Cartier, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Our planet is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our daily lives have been turned upside down. I am thinking of you, our seniors, valuable individuals who built our country. You have gone through a very restrictive confinement. You have had to sacrifice time spent with your families. Our students also had to adapt. Their school year was turned on its head. Our graduating class, especially, saw their dream of a proper graduation vanish. The future belongs to them. They must follow their dreams. I want to say to all the essential staff and the many support organizations that they are really changing things. We have all taken on our important responsibility, that of following the guidelines. The results have been most compelling in my riding. I want to say how proud I am to represent you here, in the Canadian Parliament. I thank each and everyone of you. You are helping PortneufJacques-Cartier flourish. You have shown resilience, creativity, innovation and solidarity. That is commendable. Together, we will get through this ordeal and come out stronger.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Gazan.", "Ms. Leah Gazan (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): Mr. Chair, today I rise to honour Justice 4 Black Lives Winnipeg, led by women and non-binary individuals, who stood together and mobilized our city to state clearly that we will not stand by and stay silent in the face of police brutality. We will not stand by in the face of systemic racism. We will not stand by while we witness our bodies being abused by centuries of racism supported through legislation that has left us vulnerable at the hands of those who abuse their power. We will speak out against police violence. We will speak out against systemic racism. We will join together to ensure that laws are instituted that are designed to protect us, not abuse us. We will call out those who abuse their power. We will rise. We will rise. We will rise. To all the women and non-binary folks who are standing, I say, let's continue to sound our voices in solidarity and support of one another until indigenous and black lives are honoured and respected. Our liberation is intertwined. Solidarity.", "The Chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille, go ahead.", "Mrs. Claude DeBellefeuille (SalaberrySurot, BQ): Mr.Chair, this is not the time for governments to get complacent about COVID-19. However, the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless Prime Minister. First, he locked down Parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition, while the economic recovery must be prepared. He is refusing to provide an economic update, even though the Parliamentary Budget Officer is calling for it. We need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic. He is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers. The increase Quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave, and not after it. Finally, today, he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed. He is behaving as if he had a majority government. This is not a time for recklessness. Governing means anticipating. I am asking the Prime Minister to pull himself together.", "The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Uppal.", "Hon. Tim Uppal (Edmonton Mill Woods, CPC): Mr. Chair, I rise to give thanks and recognition to the contributions of many businesses and organizations across my riding of Edmonton Mill Woods that have stepped up in a major way during this pandemic. I joined my friends in the Filipino community who partnered with Mill Woods' Calvary Community Church to deliver care packages to seniors. Varinder Bhullar and his Green Scholars of Alberta team and Dil-E-Punjab restaurant provided thousands of free meals. Sikh Youth Edmonton delivered free groceries to families, seniors and students. Edmonton Towing and its full team with Dukh Nivaran Gudwara prepared food packages for any truckers who were coming through Edmonton. The Bhartiya Cultural Society Hindu temple provided free meals to anyone who needed them. Punjab Insurance and The Punjab chain of restaurants provided free meals in downtown Edmonton. The staff, nurses and doctors of Grey Nuns Community Hospital in the heart of Mill Woods have been keeping people safe and healthy. I want to thank our Mill Woods community as a whole for its continued strength, resilience and compassion as we move forward together.", "The Chair: We'll now proceed to Mr. Fonseca.", "Mr. Peter Fonseca (Mississauga EastCooksville, Lib.): Mr. Chair, today is Portugal Day, celebrated both in Portugal and around the world by Portuguese. In Canada, June has been recognized as Portuguese Heritage Month. We're truly happy to recognize the great contributions made by Canadians of Portuguese descent. This year is a difficult one, though, for all of us, including our Portuguese diaspora community across the globe that is deeply affected by the COVID situation. Our prayers and well wishes are with everyone. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our luso community of over half a million members in Canada from coast to coast for staying strong during these difficult times. Your warmth, hard work and team spirit resonate well across my riding of Mississauga EastCooksville and globally. As a Portuguese immigrant who came to Canada at the age of two with my family, I know this year will be a lot different from previous years. I encourage all of you to stay safe and enjoy a Portuguese meal, and please continue to support our local businesses.", "The Chair: We now begin the period of questions for ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice in order to allow employees who provide support for sitting to substitute each other very safely. The first question goes to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Scheer.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister is doing everything to avoid being accountable to Canadians. He is refusing to table a budget, refusing to provide an economic update and refusing to let the House of Commons do its work. Will he at least provide the Auditor General with the additional funding she needs to look into government expenditures?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Mr.Chair, not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help Canadians with the Canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities, but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that. I hope the opposition parties will allow a vote and a debate in the House on this important bill.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister wants parliamentarians to vote on aspects of the government's spending. We want the Auditor General to be able to examine that government spending. Under the government, the Auditor General has had to do more with less, and her ability to conduct audits is being affected. The Auditor General has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits, despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending. I have a simple question. Will the Prime Minister give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job, yes or no?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we worked with the Auditor General to increase the funding of the Auditor General's office in 2018-19, and the equivalent of 38 full-time staff were added. We support the Auditor General, unlike the Conservative government, which fired 60 people from the Auditor General's office. We are now proposing that we sit down to debate legislation this afternoon, and I certainly hope that members opposite will vote for debate.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: The Prime Minister is again engaged in revisionist history. He well knows that it was the Auditor General's office that volunteered to make administrative efficiencies, which did not affect its ability to do the job. In fact, as the interim auditor general, John Wiersema, said, We would not have proposed if we didnt think it was the right thing to do and that wed be able to carry out our role for Parliament. Only the government's refusal to grant that extra funding is hampering the Auditor General's ability to give Canadians the answers they deserve, and we wonder why. This is the government that cannot explain where 20,000 infrastructure projects went and where five billion dollars' worth of supposed infrastructure investments have gone. They can't identify that. Then there is, of course, the $35-billion Infrastructure Bank, which has completed precisely zero projects. Are these the reasons the Prime Minister is so intent on withholding funds from the Auditor General?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, talking of revisionist history, Stephen Harper's Conservatives cut $6.5 million from the Auditor General's budget and fired 60 staff. On the contrary, we worked with the Auditor General's office and increased its funding and added the equivalent of 38 new full-time staff. We will continue to demonstrate openness and transparency. We will continue to respect the officers of Parliament, whom the Conservatives, in their time in office, showed no respect for. We will continue to move forward in a way that has led, for example, to proposing debate and voting on important legislation this afternoon to help Canadians. The Conservatives don't seem to want that debate or vote.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it's no surprise that the Prime Minister likes to reach back into history from before the 2015 election to justify his position. The 2015 election was the only time he got more votes than the Conservative Party did, so I understand why he likes to live in the past. In May, the interim auditor general said, Ten years ago, we were completing about 27 performance audits every year. With our current resources, we expect to be able to deliver 14 performance audits each year. That's half the number of audits, despite a massive explosion in government spending. The Auditor General's office has requested more funds to be able to do the job that Canadians expect to be done. Will the Prime Minister give those additional funds to the Auditor General's office, yes or no?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we very much look forward to working with the new Auditor General to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions. Speaking of what is foundational to our institutions, this afternoon we're putting forward a bill that would help Canadians across the country, and we've proposed to debate and vote on that bill. It actually looks like the Conservatives and other opposition parties might not want this. They have been complaining about not having debates and votes in Parliament, and now they're proposing not to have them. That's a little head-scratching. We hope they're going to help Canadians.", "The Chair: We will continue with Mr.Blanchet.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. We may have a chance here to replace a problem with a good opportunity. This morning, we heard many groups and organizations that represent people with a disability express their concerns over the bill introduced by the government, which I feel is chocolate pudding containing cod liver oil. We agree with the chocolate pudding. We are favourable to helping people with a disability. People don't know the rules. They don't knowI am telling them nowthat a bill can be divided. It can be cut into parts and voted on in parts. The rest of the bill can be enhanced. I am saying to the Prime Minister that, if he presents the part on disabled individuals, it will be passed at the speed of light. He won't even see it happen. Is he prepared to divide the bill, so that we can work together to help people with a disability?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: The bill that we are proposing this afternoon will certainly help people living with disabilities. We can always recognize that this is important, and every party should be open to it. We will also increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit from four-week intervals to two weeks. We will also expand the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses will have access to it. I am always willing to work with members of the opposition to ensure that we adopt these measures, all or some of the measures. We want to help Canadians. We look forward to debating and voting on this later today.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: It is a glorious day. I heard all or some of the measures. That means that we are not adopting them all at the same time and that the bill is being split. Can the Prime Minister confirm that he is in fact going to split his bill so that we can address the various components separately, since they have nothing to do with each other, and improve them, in keeping with our mandate as elected officials?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Our goal on this side of the House, and it is shared by all members of the House, is to help Canadians during the pandemic. We have put forward a number of measures that will help Canadians in a tangible way. Yes, that includes Canadians living with disabilities, but it also includes businesses that cannot, but should be able to, access the wage subsidy. In addition, we are going to make the Canada emergency response benefit more flexible. I look forward to continuing the discussions", "The Chair: Mr.Blanchet has the floor.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: We almost had some clarity, but one swallow does not make a summer. Yes, there is a need for discussions on the Canada emergency response benefit. The government says that it wants to transform the program into something very coercive, without admitting that the lack of an employment incentive has essentially sabotaged another program, the wage subsidy. That deserves some thought. That is what we are elected to do. We do not need to spend eight months on this, we can fix it in a few hours. When the government says that we are going to have to vote on this, it means rubber stamping its bill. We have the right to debate it, to have discussions and to improve it. I watched the election on the night of October21. It was a beautiful night. It was more fun than a hockey game. People elected a minority government. Can the government admit that?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: We are not proposing only to vote on this bill this afternoon, we are proposing to debate it. It is the role and responsibility of all of us in the House to exchange ideas and to work together to help Canadians. That is exactly what we are proposing this afternoon. It is about helping people with disabilities, increasing the flexibility of the CERB, and expanding the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses have access to it. I look forward to debating this with my colleagues opposite.", "The Chair: Mr.Blanchet, you have 43seconds left.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: That will be enough. I would be remiss if I allowed the Prime Minister to mislead people quite unintentionallyI say this in accordance with the Standing Orders. When we introduce a bill, we discuss it at second reading, we vote, we continue to discuss it and we send it to committee. All that can be done very quickly. However, we must be able to amend and improve this bill. That is how the normal Parliament works. The government doesn't like being in a minority situation. It behaves as if it were a majority government, but it is not. Can we follow the real procedures of Parliament, do a proper job, and then have a vote that is likely to suit the majority of members, not just the Prime Minister?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, my hon. colleague seems to completely forget that we are going through a pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis requires different actions on our part. That is why we provided the text of the bill to the opposition parties four days ago. We have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill, if they had amendments to propose. That is how we are taking action to help Canadians quickly during this crisis, and that is what we will continue to do.", "The Chair: Mr.Singh, you have the floor.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP): Mr.Chair, will the Prime Minister make a clear and direct commitment today to extend the CERB for families who need it?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help Canadians living with disabilities, will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit. We hope to be able to debate it.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB for families in need, yes or no?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: As I said, Mr. Chair, discussions are ongoing on that, but I can assure Canadians we will continue to be there for them and support them, as we have been.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, a family that needs to buy groceries can't take those pretty words and buy groceries with them. We're asking the Prime Minister to extend the CERB for families in need. Will the Prime Minister do that, yes or no?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to be there for Canadians in the right way. We are engaged with stakeholders, with opposition parties and with Canadians to ensure that we continue to support them the way they need to be supported.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, I can tell you what the right way is. Don from Burnaby sent me a note saying he's an arts worker and there is no forecast for his job to be reopened. He is now dependent on the CERB. He wants to go back to work, but there's no work. He sent an email saying he's faced with a grim realityhis wordsand he's frightened that if the CERB runs out, and it is planned to run out at the end of this month, then he will have no way to afford to make ends meet. Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB so Don does not have to live in fear?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, as I said, and as we have been saying from the beginning, we will continue to be there to support Canadians who need it. The member opposite is not actually looking at the fact that we are proposing three significant helps for Canadians this afternoon. We are proposing to help Canadians with disabilities, to expand the wage subsidy for more businesses and to create flexibility for the CERB. He doesn't even want to debate those things. He doesn't even want to be voting on them. Will the NDP allow us to move forward on these important measures for Canadians?", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, let's talk about those measures. One of the things we asked the government to do five weeks ago was to bring in help for Canadians living with disabilities. Now the government's plan is only going to help 40% of Canadians living with disabilities. Will the government commit to helping all Canadians living with disabilities and propose a plan that will do so?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the NDP leader seems to have decided that rather than help 40%, or a significant portion, of people with disabilities, he wants to help none of them, because he's not going to allow the debate to move forward on this bill. That's unfortunate. We're always happy to look at how we can do more. We have demonstrated from the beginning that we want to do more for Canadians. I look forward to working with the NDP. I am hoping those members change their minds and allow us to have an important debate this afternoon.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, I appreciate that the Prime Minister accepts that his plan only helps 40% of Canadians living with disabilities. Let's talk about the 60% who aren't being helped. They are veterans living with disabilities, those who receive CPP and those who receive disability payments. Often it's the poorest of Canadians living with disabilities who won't be helped with the plan the government is proposing. Will the government help all Canadians living with disabilities?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, our proposal will help 100% of Canadians who receive the disability tax credit, including many veterans. The fact is that we are there to support the disability community. We are there to support Canadians with disabilities. Why is the NDP not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation?", "The Chair: Mr. Singh, we have 43 seconds for a question and an answer.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, that's the exact problem with the Liberal proposal. It's a tax credit approach, which excludes the vast majority of Canadians living with disabilities. That is the wrong approach. We made it very clear that if the government extends the CERB, if it ensures there are no penalties on those who are desperately in need of help and if it helps all Canadians living with disabilities, we will move forward. Will the government do that?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, as I have said from the beginning, we look forward to continuing to work with the members opposite to keep moving forward to help Canadians. However, we need the opposition parties to actually choose to help Canadians and not to play political games. I hope we're going to be able to actually have a debate and a vote on this important legislation this afternoon.", "The Chair: We're now going to take a short pause to allow staff to change up in a safe way respecting COVID-19 procedure. The floor now goes to Mr. Rayes.", "Mr. Alain Rayes (RichmondArthabaska, CPC): Mr.Chair, can the Prime Minister tell us whether we will have an economic update by the end of June?", "Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance): Mr.Chair, I would like to thank the hon. member for his question. It is of course very important to be transparent. When the situation is stable, we will have", "The Chair: Once again, the floor goes to Mr.Rayes.", "Mr. Alain Rayes: Mr.Chair, most of the provinces in Canada are working on tabling economic updates by the end of June. Why is the Liberal government unable to do so as well?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: I understand the importance of transparency and that is why we are trying every day to explain our investments to Canadians and to continue to be transparent with them.", "Mr. Alain Rayes: The Liberal government announced hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending during the pandemic, but it still refuses to provide an economic update in order to be transparent with Canadians. In times of crisis, monitoring the situation is more important than ever. I repeat my question: why does this government not want to table an economic update by the end of June, when the provinces are doing so?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Every day, we explain the economic situation, our investments, the changes we are making, and our programs to improve the situation of Canadians during the pandemic. We will continue our approach to being transparent.", "Mr. Alain Rayes: The Parliamentary Budget Officer himself does not understand why the federal government cannot deliver an economic update when the provinces can. Why are the government and the minister defying the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who is an independent officer and is requesting an economic update?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: We will continue with our approach, which is one of transparency. We know that it's very difficult to make projections given the very dynamic nature of the situation. We think our approach of providing information daily is appropriate and we will continue to be transparent about our investments.", "Mr. Alain Rayes: That is incredible. When we listen to the minister and the Prime Minister talk, you would think we were in the pesky terrible twos phase that children go through, when they keep saying no, no, no. I find it funny that the provinces are able to table an economic update in a crisis situation. The opposition parties are asking for it, as are experts and officials. When the time comes for the government to listen to the scientists, it has no problem doing so. However, if people do not think like the government, it ignores them. The provinces are doing it, the opposition parties are calling for it and the Parliamentary Budget Officer is calling for it. Why will the Minister of Finance not table an economic update so that all members of Parliament can do their verification work?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: I will continue to provide daily information on our measures and investments. Projections are clearly very difficult to make. However, when the situation is more stable, we will be able to provide more information to Canadians. In the meantime, we will be adapting to the situation on a daily basis and making sure that we have the information we need to make our decisions and to make sure that Canadians understand our situation.", "The Chair: Mr.Rayes, you have 45seconds left.", "Mr. Alain Rayes: Mr.Chair, one month ago, the Prime Minister announced with great fanfare that the eligibility criteria for the $40,000emergency loans for businesses would be more flexible to help self-employed entrepreneurs and businesses that pay themselves dividends to have access to them. However, as of todayit has been four weeks since that announcementbusinesses are still banging their heads on the doors of their financial institutions. They do not have access to the information because it is not available on official websites. In addition, even senior officials confirmed to me during a technical call on June2, last Tuesday, that this information would not be available for several weeks. Can the Minister of Finance, who says he wants to act quickly to help our businesses, explain why, after four weeks, it is still not possible to get the information the Prime Minister promised us from his doorstep?", "Hon. Mona Fortier (Minister of Middle Class Prosperity and Associate Minister of Finance): Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been listening and responding to small businesses and entrepreneurs across the country. In fact, we have even announced the expansion of the program's eligibility criteria to include many owner-managed small businesses with payrolls of less than$20,000. The new criteria have forced financial institutions to adapt to be able to provide this program to new applicants. We are working around the clock to ensure that we are able to promptly provide small businesses across the country with the assistance they need.", "The Chair: We will now proceed to Mr. Allison.", "Mr. Dean Allison (Niagara West, CPC): Mr. Chair, Canada's unemployment rate stands at 13.7%. That's the highest it's been in almost four decades. Many industries, like travel, hospitality and tourism, are getting crushed. We rely on a lot of hospitality and tourism in my riding of Niagara West. Can the government tell us what their plans are to help the travel, hospitality and tourism industry that so many of my constituents depend on?", "Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages): Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for his important question. I had a good conversation with the mayor of Niagara Falls recently, and we believe in the importance of the tourism sector. That's exactly why we've extended the wage subsidy until the end of August. There is the CEBA loan, the $40,000 loan. There is also spending through FedDev in my colleague's region. If he has clear, specific projects in the tourism sector that he needs help with, I would ask that he please come and see me and have a conversation.", "Mr. Dean Allison: Mr. Chair, the message from the president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Perrin Beatty, and also other industries, is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what's going to happen through the strategy. What I've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence. What is the government doing to make this happen?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we absolutely agree. It is important for businesses to have an understanding of the programs that we've put in place. We have been consulting with businesses on the appropriate way to extend the wage subsidy so that we can continue to support businesses as they turn towards a safe restart. We've also looked very carefully at how we can ensure that the programs that we've put forward", "The Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Allison.", "Mr. Dean Allison: Mr. Chair, this government has come way short of meeting the Canadian demand for personal protective equipment. Some equipment procured from overseas has been substandard and couldn't be used. Because of the shortage, in my riding of Niagara West, dentists have to pay up to 10 times the amount for an N95 mask. Compared to early March, when will the government finally begin to produce enough PPE in Canada to meet Canadian demand?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry): Mr. Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for his question. We have mobilized over 700 Canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in Canada as part of a made-in-Canada initiative. We're going to continue to work with industry to build up domestic capacity.", "Mr. Dean Allison: Global News is reporting that Canada is struggling to secure a reliable source of PPE. What's the evidence of this? We know that the government procured 10 million substandard N95 masks that couldn't be used. Masks were sent back to suppliers for having flaws. We received mouldy swabs to be used in COVID-19 tests. Planes are arriving empty that should have been filled with PPE, and we received less than 5% of our total order of gloves. It's clear that Canada needs to rely on Canada for PPE. When will this government finally begin to take PPE equipment issues seriously and make enough in Canada to meet demands by Canadians?", "Hon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement): Mr. Chair, the honourable member's questions were tainted with inaccuracies. Regarding the flights that returned from China without federal cargo, Air Canada did reimburse the federal government for that amount. In addition, with regard to the N95 masks that were referenced, the Government of Canada will not pay for masks that it does not use. Furthermore, as my colleague Minister Bains just stated, we are mobilizing and retooling the domestic industry. Over half of the face shields that we have received were produced in Canada.", "Mr. Dean Allison: At a time when the Prime Minister has ordered Canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed, at a time when Canadians have had to say goodbye to their relatives over Skype, at a time when Canadians are not allowed to get married, at a time when Canadians are being fined for taking their kids to the park, at a time when restaurants are being fined $800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced, in these times, the Prime Minister's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing. Mr. Chair, why is it that there seems to be one set of rules in this country for some people but a different set for the Prime Minister? Why the double standard?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health): Mr. Chair, as the member knows, this country has been gripped with the need to stand up with one another to fight the experience of racism that so many Canadians live with and that so many of our American cousins live with. As the member knows, local public health sets advice for regions that he specified, and I would encourage all Canadians to check with local public health advice before they resume activities.", "The Chair: Now we'll go to Mr. Chiu.", "Mr. Kenny Chiu (StevestonRichmond East, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Many Canadian veterans are noticing that medical providers are increasing their costs. Everything is more expensive these days, including medicine, etc. It can take upwards of a year for Veterans Affairs to adjust their rate scale to compensate, and they do not allow for retroactive reimbursement. What are the government's actions to alleviate this hardship for our men and women who stood guard for this country, our veterans?", "Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Veterans Affairs): Mr. Chair, the fact is that when we inherited the government, Veterans Affairs needed a lot of support from government. In fact, at that time, we invested $10 billion to make sure that Veterans Affairs was put in place and that we could provide the appropriate supports for veterans, like the pension for life, the centre of excellence on PTSD and the chronic pain centre of excellence. All of these things are so important. We have to realize that with government previously", "The Chair: We'll now go back to Mr. Chiu.", "Mr. Kenny Chiu: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Minister, for answeringor respondingto my question, although that really did not provide an answer, in my humble opinion. Part of the side effect of spending hundreds of millions of dollars is inflation. My constituents in StevestonRichmond East are overwhelmingly finding this government's support for seniors inadequate. The opposition has put forward clear proposals, such as a one-time tax-free withdrawal being allowed for an RRSP or a RRIF. So far, the government has not taken any action on this. Why is the government ignoring suggestions to help Canadian seniors?", "Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors): Mr. Chair, I want seniors to know that they are not alone. To help preserve their registered retirement income fund assets, we are reducing minimum withdrawals by 25% for 2020. We're also providing direct financial support so that seniors can get the help they need now. As the market is volatile during this time, we continue to look at all ways that we can best help seniors during this difficult time.", "Mr. Kenny Chiu: Mr. Chair, the Hong Kong government has arrested 9,000 civilians just in the past year. This is equivalent to the arrest of 42,000 people, proportional to Canada's population. It is anticipated that more unjust incarcerations will occur as Beijing imposes the national security law in Hong Kong. Has our government started preparing a list of names for Magnitsky-style sanctions, yes or no?", "Hon. Marc Garneau (Minister of Transport): Mr. Chair, as we have said, we and our allies are deeply concerned with Beijing's decision to impose a national security law on Hong Kong. With hundreds of thousands of Canadians living in Hong Kong, we have a vested interest in its stability and prosperity, the foundations of which are Hong Kong's relative autonomy and basic freedoms. The proposed law would also undermine the one country, two systems framework.", "Mr. Kenny Chiu: I thank the minister for responding. Again, however, words are not enough. It's time for action, because the Chinese embassy has said, in response to Canada's expressed concern, that they deplore, reject and condemn our response and our concerns thus far. What are the conditions for this government using Magnitsky sanctions should China continue to incarcerate Canadians and jeopardize the human rights of its citizens?", "Hon. Marc Garneau: Mr. Chair, we have been very clear. We will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the Hong Kong population. Canada will always support and promote freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world.", "The Chair: Mr. Chiu, we have about 22 seconds, so you have time for a very quick question and hopefully a very quick answer.", "Mr. Kenny Chiu: Okay, here's a quick question. The Communist Chinese government has lied about COVID-19. They have issued statements against Canada and they have yet to release the two Canadians being held hostage. My constituents are concerned over this. When will this government listen to Canadians and call for a stronger, more effective and truly independent international investigation into COVID-19's origin?", "The Chair: The honourable minister has 22 seconds or less, please.", "Hon. Marc Garneau: Mr. Chair, we are dealing with a global pandemic, COVID-19. It is critically important that all countries in the world work together in a transparent, open and respectful manner so that we understand what is going on and how we can bring it to an end as quickly as possible.", "The Chair: The next question will come from Ms. Gallant.", "Mrs. Cheryl Gallant (RenfrewNipissingPembroke, CPC): Mr. Chair, if the government orders someone who has been exposed to a confirmed COVID case into a 14-day quarantine, why won't the government allow them to take an antibody test to lift the quarantine so they can go back to work?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: As the member opposite may or may not know, testing strategies are determined by provinces and territories. Furthermore, the testing of a particular person has to be done at the right point in time", "The Chair: We go back to Ms. Gallant.", "Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Mr. Chair, there have already been some tests that have been approved. My friend and colleague here, Colin Carrie, from the constituency of Oshawa, has a constituent who has a test. It's 90% accurate and it's being sold to the United States and other countries. Why won't they provide a DIN number to it so that Canadians have access to it as well, regardless of which province or territory they live in?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I think the member is talking about two separate things. Any test kit that would be approved by Health Canada would be accessible to wherever that company chose to market that test kit. Furthermore, it's really important that test kits that are approved by Health Canada be accurate and have been tested with rigour with regard to their ability to provide credible and accurate information to the people who are using that test.", "Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Mr. Chair, the test has proven to have an accuracy rate of 90% in identifying whether or not an individual has antibodies. Why won't she allow it to be used here?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I am happy to follow up with the member opposite's office when she is able to provide me with the name of the company. As you can imagine, there are many vendors trying to", "The Chair: We go back to Ms. Gallant.", "Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: How long will it take for an antibody test to be approved by this government once you have the name of the company and the test and the evidence in front of you?", "The Chair: Before we go to the honourable minister, I just want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair and not directly. Go ahead, Minister.", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: We have an expedited process that could be completed in as little as five to seven days, depending on the accuracy of the test and the information supplied by the vendor.", "Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Through you, Mr. Chair, will Health Canada use reputable data from other countries to speed their determinations about antibody effectiveness, or just continue to withhold access?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Canadians expect us, at Health Canada, to ensure the accuracy and the safety of all equipment approved for use in Canada.", "Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Mr. Chairman, if the minister can approve tests and studies within five days, why is it taking over 30, over 60, or over 90 days to approve an antibody test that exists?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: I appreciate the member opposite's interest in urgent and quick approvals; however, sometimes, depending on the company, there may be further questions and further tests that need to be run to ensure the accuracy or safety of that equipment. Should she wish me to check into the process for a particular", "The Chair: We will go back to Ms. Gallant.", "Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Have officials provided the government with a target for a daily antibody test to complete an initial survey or the initial phase of a study?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I assume the member opposite is talking about the work of the immunity task force, which is, as you know, a group of scientists who have been funded by the Government of Canada", "The Chair: We'll go back to Ms. Gallant.", "Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: Through you, Mr. Chair, would the minister please provide the names of the people on the task force to which she just referred?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I will forward those names to the office of the member opposite.", "Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: I hope that will be within the next two days or so, and not wait until after the crisis has passed, Mr. Chairman. Why isn't the Prime Minister showing as much fervour for antibody testing as he is for getting a vaccine on the market?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I reject the premise of that question. In fact, the Prime Minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage. To allege otherwise is quite disingenuous.", "The Chair: We'll go on to Mr. Kelly.", "Mr. Pat Kelly (Calgary Rocky Ridge, CPC): When will the government give the Auditor General the funds she needs to do her job?", "Hon.

On behalf of the government, I would also like to offer her our full support and collaboration", "The Chair: We'll go to Mr. Kelly.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: I share the minister's wish to congratulate the new Auditor General on her position. I will now ask him again when he will give her the funds she needs to do her job.", "Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, her role is essential to our democracy. We are eager to work with her. She's more than welcome to share her concerns directly with the government. I can assure her that my", "The Chair: We'll go to Mr. Kelly.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, I didn't ask him if he would like to work with the Auditor General. I asked him if he will give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job.", "Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, our government has added 38 permanent staff positions to her office, while the Conservative government, under their leadership, cut the funding for more than 60", "The Chair: We'll move on to Mr. Kelly.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, through you, I caution the minister to not mislead this House. If he will look at the committee transcripts of the time, he will know that it was the Auditor General's decision to reduce their own budget. The Conservatives did not cut positions. That is a matter of fact. The point is that the Auditor General now does not have the money to do her job. She has cut performance audits and she has stopped work on performance audits. When will this government give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job?", "Hon. Steven Guilbeault: With us, it was 38 new positions, Mr. Chair. With them, it was 60 positions fewer.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, this government has drastically expanded its spending and is avoiding accountability in every way it can. The finance committee yesterday, with the support of Liberal backbench MPs who are on that committee, unanimously passed a motion to fund the Auditor General in full so that her office can do her job. If this minister will not listen to me, will he at least listen to his own backbenchers?", "Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, our government is fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the Auditor General, an independent officer of Parliament. If the Auditor General identifies the need for additional resources, we will work with the Office of the Auditor General to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue fulfilling their mandate efficiently and effectively.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, the Auditor General has consistently, since 2018, told this government that the office doesn't have enough funds. It's not a mystery. The Auditor General has told the public accounts committee that it cannot do its job. It's the first time in history that the Auditor General has had to tell public accounts that they don't have the resources to do their job. It's not a matter of if the Auditor General needs more funds. The Auditor General couldn't be more clear. When will this government actually do the right thing and fully fund the Office of the Auditor General?", "Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, maybe I'm not making myself clear in English. I will switch to my native tongue, French, in case it becomes clearer. If the Auditor General identifies a need for additional resources, we will work with her to ensure that her office can continue to deliver its mandate efficiently and effectively. In addition, our government worked with the Auditor General to increase funding in 2018-09. With this increase, the office was able to add the equivalent of 38new full-time staff to its team. That's 38more employees", "The Chair: The floor goes to Mr.Kelly.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, this isn't an if situation. The Auditor General has already told this government that her office does not have funds. This has been ongoing since 2018. I would ask the minister to please stop with the platitudes and actually just say yes or no. Will the government give the Auditor General the money that the Auditor General has already asked for?", "Hon.

No member wants to do that. It's always customary to give members a chance to correct the record, so I call upon the minister to do so now, and perhaps even the Prime Minister.

I would also like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague and friend, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. Obrigado. While Quebec estimates its additional health care costs related to COVID-19 at $3billion, Ottawa is transferring around $115million, which is not even4%. Does the government recognize that this is clearly insufficient?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Madam Chair, as the member opposite knows, we invested an initial $500 million in transfers to the provinces and territories to manage the extreme pressure put on health care systems as a result of their supporting people living with COVID and in preventing COVID. We want to thank the provinces and territories for their work, and as the member opposite knows, we will continue to be there for the provinces and territories. This is a significant transfer, and we think", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr.Ste-Marie, you have the floor.", "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: MadamChair, the minister says that this is a substantial transfer. Yes, it is a lot of money. The government is giving about $115million to Quebec, but that is not even 4%of what is being requested. Does the minister recognize that much more is needed?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: We have been working with the provinces and territories from the beginning to respond to the crisis. We have increased health care transfers, provided medical protective equipment and responded to all requests for assistance.

Stirring up an imaginary quarrel between the federal government and Quebec", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr.Ste-Marie, you have the floor.", "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: MadamChair, it isn't about squabbling, it's about needs. The share that the federal government is giving isn't enough. We should act now, before we see a possible second wave. What we're seeing today are the results of massive disinvestment by the federal government in health care. This isn't good enough. The government must act quickly. Can the government commit to better funding to the health care sector and to organizing a meeting with Quebec and the provinces on this exact topic, in September at the latest? We can't afford to wait.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The hon. minister's response will have to be brief.", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Madam Chair, with respect to the transfers to provinces and territories, the member opposite knows that our government, in our last mandate, significantly increased transfers to the provinces and territories for health services, including mental health and home care services. In fact, the funding we're providing is in addition to the $40 billion that was transferred", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr.Brunelle-Duceppe.", "Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ): Thank you, MadamChair.   Tudo bem? Tudo bom?  Today in La Presse, we learned that the government has extended its military presence in long-term care homes. Can the minister confirm this information, and can he also confirm that the presence of these 500soldiers is indeed in response to a request from the Government of Quebec?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Madam Chair, let me assure the member that when Quebec made a request for assistance at the beginning of April, we answered the call. When they asked for an extension of that, we said we would continue to provide that assistance. I had a conversation today with Minister Guilbault, my counterpart in Quebec, and we have renewed our commitment to continuing to provide assistance. That assistance can take additional forms and can include involving the Canadian Red Cross, but we remain committed to providing the assistance that Quebec needs.", "Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe: If I understand correctly, negotiations are still under way with the Government of Quebec, even though it needs these soldiers. The mission ends Friday. This isn't really the time to negotiate anymore. We have to make sure that the military will stay in our long-term care homes as long as we need their services in Quebec, and until new attendants have been trained. Can the minister confirm that the mission will indeed be extended?", "Hon. Bill Blair: I'd like to assure this House that we have assured Quebec that the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to provide support until such time as other trained professional people are able to do that job. We're working very hard with the Province of Quebec. We're working with the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian Red Cross. We will be there for Quebeckers because they need our help, and as long as they need our help, we'll be there to support them.", "Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe: This isn't the time to play cat-and-mouse. The only thing we have to do is to give the Government of Quebec what it's asking for. Quebec pays 23%of the army's budget, so Quebeckers are entitled to this support. Quebec has more than 5,000deaths from COVID-19, 90%of which have been in seniors' residences or long-term care homes. The military's presence is vital because they play an extraordinary and essential role. Will the minister commit to extending the mission now and putting an end to this uncertainty? It's certainly bad for both the military and the health care workers, who rely on this support.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The hon. minister has 10seconds.", "Hon. Bill Blair: Again, Madam Chair, let me be very clear. We have made a commitment to the Province of Quebec that we will continue to provide that support until the middle of September, exactly as they have requested, but we are also working to ensure that we have an sustainable, effective solution to the request that Quebec has made, so we're working with the Province of Quebec, the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian Red Cross to ensure the help that is needed is there.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We will go now to Bryan May.", "Mr. Bryan May (Cambridge, Lib.): Thank you very much, Madam Chair. It's a pleasure and an honour to be with you all today. I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the member of Parliament for Scarborough North. Madam Chair, COVID-19 continues to create challenges for all Canadians, including those with disabilities, and exacerbates those experienced by Canadians with disabilities. As we mark the end of National AccessAbility Week, I would like to remind our colleagues that our commitment to making Canada more inclusive and equitable is ongoing, including our passing of the Accessible Canada Act. Would the minister inform the House about the government's plans to support Canadians with disabilities who are experiencing increased costs due to COVID-19?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion): Madam Chair, last week was the first National AccessAbility Week that was legislated under the historic Accessible Canada Act, and I thank every party in this House for the consent they gave to that legislation. I'm hoping we have the same spirit of camaraderie for people with disabilities this afternoon. Since the beginning, Madam Chair, we have taken a disability inclusion approach on how we support people with disabilities in this time of pandemic, including the establishment of our COVID-19 disability advisory group, which has given us invaluable advice. I thank them so much for their contributions to our efforts. Last week we announced a suite of measures to support people with disabilities that complement existing measures that are in place. This includes a one-time payment of $600 to 1.25 million citizens with disabilities, which again is the subject matter of the legislation this afternoon, as well as a $15-million investment in an accessible workplace initiative that will ensure, moving forward.... We know that as we move back into employment situations it will be very tough for people with disabilities. Finally, there are five really exciting accessible technology initiatives, including working on point-of-sale terminals for Canadians who are blind or visually impaired.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): You may have a very short question, Mr. May.", "Mr. Bryan May: I want to take this opportunity to thank the minister and her department for all the work they are doing to ensure that accessibility is at the forefront of everybody's mind through this crisis.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr. Chen is next.", "Mr. Shaun Chen (Scarborough North, Lib.): Madam Chair, as humanity battles COVID-19, we are confronted by the stark realities of another disease. On May 25, George Floyd fell unconscious and died as a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. This all happened after the 46-year-old black man was handcuffed and put in a position where he could do no harm. In Canada, we have come a long way since Viola Desmond, yet there is much more to do. Anti-black racism is institutionalized, hidden under dominant narratives of a free and multicultural society. Hatred has no boundaries, whether it is against black communities or is anti-Asian sentiment fuelled by COVID-19. The question always is this: Who is next? We must all stand up together against hatred and for justice and reconciliation, to dismantle systems of oppression that long remained unquestioned. Recent data from Statistics Canada shows that Canada is failing black youth, creating the conditions that push them into the justice system. To the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, my question is this: What is the government doing to address the unique challenges faced by black youth?", "Hon. Bardish Chagger (Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth): Madam Chair, the member for Scarborough North is absolutely correct. We must all do what we can to stand up against hatred and injustice. We often say that today's youth are not only the leaders of tomorrow but the leaders of today, so we need to equip them for success by investing in youth. According to the 2016 census, black Canadians accounted for 1.2 million people, and more than a quarter of that population is under the age of 15. Socio-economic gaps, such as in employment and education, exist between black and non-black youth. We need to do better. Our government has brought forward youth so they can inform the decisions we make. We have Canada's first youth policy, and it was created by youth for youth to ensure that all young people are equipped to live healthy and fulfilling lives, and are empowered to create positive change for themselves and their communities. Our government launched the community support for black Canadian youth program, which supported 56 projects geared to address the unique challenges faced by black Canadian youth through the development of leadership skills and civic engagement, while empowering them through the promotion of black history, culture and identity. To address the challenges of the pandemic, our government has implemented a suite of measures designed to help youth and students, including with employment and service opportunities. My office is working with community organizations who serve black youth to make sure they too are both aware of and benefiting from these measures.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Ms. Mathyssen is next.", "Ms. Lindsay Mathyssen (LondonFanshawe, NDP): Thank you, Madam Chair.

They must reduce their capacity due to COVID-19. Now more than ever we need universal, publicly funded child care to restart the economy. Will the government bring in legislation that would enshrine into law access to, and federal funding for, quality affordable child care?", "Hon. Ahmed Hussen (Minister of Families, Children and Social Development): Madam Chair, we are, of course, committed to investments in child care. We have constantly worked with provinces and territories to ensure that we provide the supports they need to provide quality, affordable and accessible child care. Since 2015, we have created over 40,000 child care spaces. We are committed to creating an additional 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces.", "Ms. Lindsay Mathyssen: The government doesn't seem to understand that this is not universal child care. During COVID-19, women have lost the majority of jobs, and they have taken on the majority of additional child care responsibilities. Canadian women want and need to return to work, but this government doesn't understand that without affordable child care, they simply cannot re-enter the workforce. For 26 years, Liberal governments have been promising, but failing to deliver, a universal child care program. Parents are paying the price. How much longer do parents have to wait?", "Hon. Ahmed Hussen: Madam Chair, I want to thank the honourable member for the important question. Since 2015, we have created 40,000 affordable, accessible, quality child care spaces across the country. We are on track to continue to invest $7.5 billion over 11 years to create additional child care spaces and support provinces and territories. We're constantly in touch with our counterparts to work to strengthen that sector. We are also keeping our promise and our commitment to create an additional 250,000 spaces. We will be there for parents as they get back to work, and we will continue to reinforce the early learning and child care sector.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): You have time for a very short question, Ms. Mathyssen.", "Ms. Lindsay Mathyssen: Without universal child care, we are crippling our economy. We are not providing an affordable system, and this stops women from returning to work. Instead of helping parents return to work, the government is now bringing forward legislation that's penalizing them. Why is the government looking to sentence mothers and fathers to jail time and large fines when they cannot find the child care that", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The honourable minister has time for a short answer.", "Hon. Ahmed Hussen: We are committed to the early learning and child care sector. We will move forward with the creation of an early learning and child care secretariat.

It's an honour to be here, and I'm hoping that you and your family stay safe at this time. COVID has shaken up Canada's middle class, so my question is for the Minister of Middle Class Prosperity. This morning I spoke with a businesswoman. She runs her own business, a travel agency, but because of COVID she has been wiped out. She's on CERB, and it's ticking down. There's no work to go back to, so in four weeks she hits the economic wall. Will the minister fight for an extension of CERB so this woman can stay in the middle class?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, we know how worried Canadians are as they see their final four-week period of the CERB approaching, and we're working very hard to ensure that the CERB continues to serve an important purpose as we move into economic recovery. I'll note that when we created the CERB, there was a different purpose in mind. We were asking people to stay home. Now we're asking people to go back to work if it's safe for them to do so. We're going to make sure that the wage subsidy and the CERB complement each other. In fact, the measures in today's legislation will help us to get the flexibility to be able to do just that.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We did give you a little more time. We will go to Mr. Angus.", "Mr. Charlie Angus: Thank you for that. What I've seen with their legislation today is that they're talking about jailing people. We need a Minister of Middle Class Prosperity in a time of middle-class disparity, and she has talked about middle-class criminality. Let's talk about this again, about people going back to work. I spoke with a 51-year-old bartender. He's a professional; this is his job. There is no job to go back to. Will the minister assure us that this man will be able to stay in the middle class because the CERB will still be there in July, yes or no?", "Hon.

We will continue to support families during the crisis, and afterwards as well.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr. Angus, you have time for a very short comment or question.", "Mr. Charlie Angus: The issue here is that when COVID hit, millions of Canadians were living in such precarious working conditions that they didn't even have enough money to pay their rent. That is a damning indictment. In four weeks, those Canadians are going to hit the economic wall again. What I need to know from the minister, and what Canadians need to know, is whether she will commit, yes or no, that the CERB will be there for those who have no work to go back to.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The honourable minister may give a very short answer.", "Hon.

We will continue to find ways to support Canadian families during this crisis.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We will go to Mr. Cooper.", "Mr. Michael Cooper (St. AlbertEdmonton, CPC): Thank you, Madam Chair. It was all the way back on March 25 that the Minister of Finance stated that help for the energy sector was coming within hours, possibly days. Well, as it turns out, it hasn't been hours. It hasn't been days. It hasn't even been weeks. Indeed, months later, help has yet to arrive. Seventy-seven days after the minister made that statement, not a single energy company has received financing under EDC, the BDC, or the LEEFF program. As the energy sector faces an unprecedented liquidity crisis, how can this government possibly justify such a delay?", "Hon. Seamus O'Regan (Minister of Natural Resources): Madam Chair, weeks ago we opened applications through the business credit availability program to support the small and medium-sized players that make up 85% of the jobs in our sector. We've also opened applications for measures that will be available to our larger players through our LEEFF program. We will continue to work with industry. We will continue to support workers, and we will continue to do so to get through this unprecedented challenge.", "Mr. Michael Cooper: Madam Chair, on June 2, the vice-president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said, The entire industry is frustrated with the delay that we are facing. The Saskatchewan Minister of Energy and Resources has spoken about a gaping hole that exists in terms of support for the energy sector. The gaping hole that I'm speaking of is the EDC and BDC programs that this government has failed to deliver upon. Indeed, it was on April 17 that those programs were announced, and 54 days later, not only has not a single energy company received financing, but guess what? They can't even apply, and the eligibility criteria have yet to be finalized after 54 days. If that is not failing to deliver for the energy sector, what is?", "Hon. Seamus O'Regan: Madam Chair, the Business Council of Alberta has said that the LEEFF program is a positive development showing that the federal government recognizes the needs and value of Canada's large corporations. We agree. It is essential that we support our oil and gas sector as it suffers through two crises: the impacts of COVID and the effects of a global price war initiated by Russia and Saudi Arabia. That's why, weeks ago, we opened applications for liquidity measures to support the small and medium-sized players that make up 85% of the jobs in our sector. We also announced liquidity made available to our larger players through the LEEFF program. We will continue to work with industry to make sure these programs are effective.", "Mr. Michael Cooper: Madam Chair, contrary to the representations of the minister, neither the EDC program nor BDC programs are accepting applications. Just yesterday officials from both BDC and EDC were before the finance committee, where I posed precisely those questions to them. We know, Madam Chair, that the application process isn't up and running and that eligibility criteria remain to be determined, but I guess this government has some good news for the energy sector after 77 days. Now energy sector companies can go on the BDC website and apply for email updates. Is that the kind of help the Minister of Finance had in mind after 77 days: email updates instead of real relief for the energy sector?", "Hon. Seamus O'Regan: Madam Chair, the Alberta finance minister, Travis Toews, said in a LEEFF announcement that in combination with earlier measures for small and medium-sized companies, it represented an expression of confidence in our industries. It is essential that we support our oil and gas sector as it suffers through these two crisesas I said, the impact of COVID, and then on top of that, the effect of a global price war. We opened up applications for liquidity measures as the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers asked. Their top five asks were all liquidity. We supported small and medium-sized players essential to the supply chain, who make up 85% of the jobs in that sector, and then we announced liquidity made available to our larger players through the LEEFF program. We will continue to work with industry and", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): I now have to interrupt for a few moments to allow our technicians to change places. With that done, Monsieur Martel, you may now go ahead..", "Mr. Richard Martel (ChicoutimiLe Fjord, CPC): MadamChair, there has recently been positive progress in AndrGauthier's case, and I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Deputy Prime Minister for their co-operation in this matter. However, Mr.Gauthier is currently on his own in the United Arab Emirates, without a passport, waiting to settle civil lawsuits. What services does the minister intend to provide to help him, and when does he plan to repatriate AndrGauthier to Canada?", "Hon. Marc Garneau: MadamChair, in all cases similar to Mr.Gauthier's, the Government of Canada, through its consular services, tries to do the best it can under the circumstances. This file is still active.", "Mr. Richard Martel: The House recognized on February18, 2020, that the 15weeks of sickness benefits provided by employment insurance were insufficient. Citizens who became ill before March15 are now without help. They are being denied the CERB because they didn't lose their jobs because of COVID-19. They are being denied EI regular benefits because they are unable to work. In addition, some citizens are waiting for surgery, which is being delayed because of COVID-19. Is the government letting these people down?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: No, MadamChair, that's absolutely not the case. Of course, we understand that people who are no longer receiving EI benefits should have access to the CERB. We have committed to extending the emergency sickness benefit to 26weeks. We're working with everyone here to make that happen. We're taking into account the needs and circumstances of all citizens in our efforts to help Canadians.", "Mr. Richard Martel: I've called on the Minister of Economic Development several times to be more flexible in establishing these programs, so that they are better adapted to the realities of the regions. Recently, it was the SMEs in Montreal that were monopolizing the funds earmarked for the regions. When will the Liberal government listen to the needs of regions like SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean?", "Hon. Mlanie Joly: I thank my colleague for the opportunity to announce the good news that was mentioned on Radio-Canada this morning, namely, $71million more for the regions of Quebec. Of course, we're here for the regions. I will be happy to work with my colleague to ensure that the CFDC in his region can support businesses. We have to support businesses in SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean and across the country.", "Mr. Richard Martel: I think that's a canned speech. According to a survey conducted by the Universit de Trois-Rivires in Quebec, the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region is apparently the most economically affected by COVID-19. We have many projects, but they depend on the government's leadership to be carried out. Our region has forestry, the aluminum sector, GNL Qubec, tourism, the Port of Saguenay, Davie Canada, a military base and a tax centre. It's all here. We know we'll have to get the economy moving again soon. When will the government act to help our region?", "Hon. Mlanie Joly: Every day, we act to help my colleague's region. I've had good conversations with Promotion Saguenay. I've also spoken several times with various stakeholders in my colleague's beautiful region. We will always be there for them. I'd like to tell my colleague that there will be other announcements to support the economic development of the beautiful region of SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean. I will be happy to work with him to achieve good results.", "Mr. Richard Martel: Sustainable forestry development is at the heart of the economic development of Canada and for SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean. Canadians have reason to be proud of the use of the boreal forest in the fight against climate change. Currently, our innovative forest industry is experiencing many problems, and on top of that, there is the COVID-19 crisis. Who will defend our forestry workers?", "Hon. Mlanie Joly: Of course, we believe in the importance of regional economic development. That's why we're always there to defend our forestry workers. I will also be pleased to work with my colleague, the Minister of Natural Resources, who is very familiar with the matter and who knows the challenges faced by the various businesses in the forestry sector, as well as the employees. We will always be there to support employees and create more jobs across Quebec and the country.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Ms. Sahota is next. Go ahead, please.", "Ms. Jag Sahota (Calgary Skyview, CPC): Thank you, Madam Chair. We continue to see significant gaps in the Liberals' programs. There are still people who are falling through the cracks and being left behind. We are hearing from women who are pregnant or who have just given birth and are being left out or told to go back to work. When will this government stop letting Canadians down?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: We know that there are many situations of Canadians who are about to or are just going on maternity or parental benefits who might not have access to their EI benefits due to not having accumulated enough time for COVID reasons. We're working very hard to make sure, as we did for fish harvesters, that we support all Canadians in these situations. I look forward to advising Canadians of our approach on this very soon.", "Ms. Jag Sahota: Madam Chair, that simply isn't good enough. This is something that has been brought to the government's attention for months now, and still nothing has been done. These families deserve answers now. Had the government conducted a GBA+ analysis, they would have discovered this prior to rolling out inadequate programs for women. Why wasn't a GBA+ conducted?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: I can assure everyone in this House that we are very aware and deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of this pandemic on women and girls. We are working hard to ensure that everyone has the supports they need. As we move forward, we are, as I said earlier, taking into consideration improvements to the EI system, the wage subsidy and the future of CERB. All these play together as we work to provide a comprehensive forward-looking support package for Canadians.", "Ms. Jag Sahota: Madam Chair, might I remind my honourable colleague that this Prime Minister said that every piece of legislation would go through a rigorous GBA+? Why was it not done?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, I can assure the member that we absolutely took into account the needs of women as we developed the CERB. I can tell you that women are benefiting significantly from this benefit.", "Ms. Jag Sahota: Madam Chair, it is a simple question, and I will ask again. Why was GBA+ analysis not conducted for the COVID-19 relief programs?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, as I said, the needs of women and girls were taken into consideration every step of the way, from the beginning, as we worked to provide a comprehensive suite of support for Canadians across the country.", "Ms. Jag Sahota: Madam Chair, if that's the case, then how did you miss these gaps?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, I can assure the member that we didn't miss gaps. We, from the beginning, looked to support as many people as possible. As we moved from supporting workers to supporting students to supporting seniors, and today to supporting people with disabilities, we are ensuring that everyone is covered by our measures. As this pandemic evolves and as we move into economic recovery, of course we're going to make sure that women in particular are supported in our measures.", "Ms. Jag Sahota: Madam Chair, the minister needs to take the responsibility here. These women and families deserve answers. This is a real problem happening right now. You said you would conduct GBA+ analysis on all policy measures moving forward. Where is the assistance for these expectant mothers?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, I take responsibility. I'm very proud of how many senior women we have supported with our measures, how many women received the GST credit, how many women who lead families received the CCB one-time payment and how many women with disabilities will receive the disability support if we have all-party consent today.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Ms. Sahota, may I remind you to please direct your questions through the chair?", "Ms. Jag Sahota: Madam Chair, I will ask again, hoping for a straightforward answer from this minister. Why was a GBA+ analysis not conducted on the COVID-19 relief programs?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: My goodness, Madam Chair. I'll say again how important it was from the very beginning that we took into account the needs of women and girls, and as we move forward into the economic recovery phase, how completely we make women at the core of every decision.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Ms. Sahota, you have 15 seconds.", "Ms. Jag Sahota: Madam Chair, my question is still not answered. She keeps repeating the same answer. I'll keep asking the same question, hoping for a straightforward answer. Why was a GBA+ analysis not conducted on the COVID-19 relief programs?", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Honourable minister, you have five seconds.", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, we've taken into account the needs of women and girls from the beginning, and we'll continue to do so.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We go now to Mr. Carrie.", "Mr. Colin Carrie (Oshawa, CPC): Madame Chair, on April 29 I asked Minister Blair why Lisa Freeman, a constituent of mine, wasn't able to participate in the Parole Board hearing of her father's murderer. The minister acknowledged that this had been a mistake and that victims would now be able to attend by telephone and video conference. Can the minister tell this House how many parole hearings have been conducted under this digital format with victims since April 29?", "Hon. Marco Mendicino (Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship): Thank you, Madam Chair. I thank my honourable colleague for the question. I'm glad to hear that Minister Blair was able to provide information on the specific case he raises. With regard to his question, we're happy to provide it to him in due course.", "Mr. Colin Carrie: Madame Chair, on April 29 the minister said, and I quote, Steps have been taken to make it possible for victims to participate in those parole hearings virtually by phone or video conference. If the change has been made, can the minister please tell us how many hearings victims have been able to participate in by video conference?", "Hon. Marco Mendicino: Madam Chair, as I said, certainly we will confirm the number of hearings that may have occurred. With regard to the hearings under the Parole Board of Canada, we want to ensure that victims and others are able to participate in a fair and transparent manner.", "Mr. Colin Carrie: Madame Chair, the website says, To protect the health and safety of the public, offenders, Parole Board...members and staff in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PBC is currently conducting its hearings remotely via video conference or teleconference. However, when referring to victim participation, the PBC says it has Implemented technological and procedural enhancements in order to provide victims...the ability to participate...via telephone. If video conference is an option for staff and inmates, why is it not for victims?", "Hon. Marco Mendicino: Madam Chair, as I said, it is very important that all parties be able to participate before the Parole Board. The Parole Board has introduced technologies to allow victims to participate in a manner that is fair and that accords them the opportunity to express themselves.", "Mr. Colin Carrie: Madam Chair, the minister is missing the point. For victims, besides the criminal trial, the Parole Board hearings are the only chance to participate in the judicial process. Why are victims not permitted on the video conference, while staff, panels and inmates are?", "Hon. Marco Mendicino: Madam Chair, as I've said now on a number of occasions, victims are able to participate in the hearings before the Parole Board. This is as a result of technology and innovations introduced by the Parole Board. Of course, those opportunities will continue to exist going forward.", "Mr. Colin Carrie: Then, Madam Chair, why did the minister and this government tell Canadians and the House that victims of crime have the opportunity to participate in parole hearings by video conference, when in fact they do not?", "Hon. Marco Mendicino: Madam Chair, as I've said, of course we are going to confirm the status of that particular request. In the meantime, as I've said on a number of occasions, victims are able to participate in these hearings. This is consistent with the fairness of those hearings and the due process we accord to them.", "Mr. Colin Carrie: Madam Chair, it's been over a month. When will the minister finally give victims of crime the same right to parole hearings by video conference as he gives convicted inmates?", "Hon. Marco Mendicino: Madam Chair, I reject that proposition. The Parole Board is a well-established tribunal that does allow for all parties, including victims, to participate in a manner that is fair, and that allows them to express themselves so those representations can be taken into account in the decisions of the Parole Board of Canada.", "Mr. Colin Carrie: He can reject it as much as he wants, Madam Chair, but it seems he thinks it's fair that inmates have that right, but victims don't. We'll follow up with him on that. Brandon Hottot owns and operates a contracting business in my riding, and his company needs help. On May 19, the Prime Minister announced the government would allow sole proprietors and gig contractors to qualify for the Canada emergency business account; however, Brandon has still not been able to take advantage of this benefit. When can small business owners like Brandon expect this change to finally be made? It's been over three weeks, and the clock is ticking.", "Hon. Mary Ng (Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade): Madam Chair, from the very beginning, we have been working hard to support our small businesses. Over 660,000 businesses today have received access to small business loans. I want to assure my colleague that additional support will be there within about a week.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr. Carrie, you may have a very short question.", "Mr. Colin Carrie: Okay, Madam Chair. Shawn and Denise operate a gymnastics facility in Whitby and have been forced to close throughout COVID-19. As the economy begins to open, they are concerned about not having the money to pay their employees in the short term, especially at a reduced client capacity. Is the government extending the wage subsidy to small businesses that have been closed and are just beginning to open now?", "Hon. Mary Ng: The wage subsidy has been extended until August 31. We hope businesses like that one will be able to take advantage of the wage subsidy to keep their employees on staff.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We will go now to Ms. May.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: Thank you, Madam Chair. Just to put it on the record, because we may or may not be debating it, the draft embargoed bill that we've seen is unacceptable to members of the Green Party caucus. My questions will relate largely to those sections that are troublesome. I'll start with a question to the honourable minister for disabilities. I certainly appreciate her work and I know her intentions are the best, but part 3 of this bill allows for the information to be shared so people can get a one-time payment of $600, which is not enough to really deal with the COVID crisis for people with disabilities. It's clearand I thank the honourable leader of the New Democratic Party for making this point clearly in question periodit will reach approximately 40% of people with disabilities because of the structure of going through the disability tax credit. To the honourable minister, are other measures under consideration to reach the rest of the people in Canada with disabilities who need help?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, the disability support payment we are proposing and that we hope to get through the House today complements a whole suite of measures our government has put in place that people with disabilities have access to. We know that people with disabilities who were precariously employed are now taking advantage of the CERB. Students with disabilities get the student benefit, including a $750-per-month top-up for four months. Families with children with disabilities are getting the CCB payment. Disproportionately, people with disabilities are benefiting from the GST payment. I should talk about the provincial letters that are being delivered to recipients of provincial disability supports. All around, Madam Chair, we're trying to get to every citizen with a disability, and this measure fills an important gap.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: Much worse than part 3, from our point of view, is the treatment of people who are at this point potentially to be jailed for refusing to return to work when it's considered reasonable and they are recipients of CERB. I wonder about the reasonableness here. It's a subjective test. This is a wrong-headed approach to go after people and threaten them. The retroactive section has already made the Canadian Civil Liberties Association question its constitutionality. To the minister, what's reasonable, and in whose eyes is it reasonable? In today's news, Hamilton's chief medical officer says there is a spike in cases among young people, who likely were exposed while taking public transit to get to work. Their commute wasn't safe. Who determines reasonableness in deciding it's not safe to go back to work?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, as with the current CERB, moving forward it tries to encompass the situations of people who are unemployed, people who can't work because of child care responsibilities, people who are ill or sick. Moving to a broad term of reasonableness allows us to look at the individual circumstances of the person. If we stuck to language like suitable or appropriate, that would qualify the job. We're trying to look at the person and their particular circumstances as we work to ensure that if someone is immunocompromised and can't take transit to their job, then it's reasonable for them not to take that job. That's the exact example we're trying to encompass with broad reasonableness criteria.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: The approach is so very flawed, Madam Chair, in that it attempts to punish people as opposed to encouraging them. I think the Liberals have been overly influenced by the Conservative Party's cries that there's vast fraud, that Canadians are cheating. The reality is that if you want to create an incentive to go back to work, you don't threaten people. What you do is create a sliding scale. You let people continue to receive CERB, but maybe less as they begin to earn more, so that you have a transition on a sliding scale to go into the wage subsidy or into CERB. I ask the honourable minister this: How can it be considered fair to say that someone isn't eligible, even though they believed they were? The language in this bill, particularly at proposed paragraph 12.1 in the penalties section, is an unreasonable determination that someone has violated the act and is subject to jail time and heavy fines.", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, because of parliamentary privilege, I can't and won't speak to specific acts of a piece of law that hasn't actually been introduced in the House, but I'll tell you that what we're trying to do is enhance our integrity measures. We're working with those people who made an honest mistake, those who took advantage of returning to work when they were still receiving the CERB. We're working with those people. We're absolutely confident that those people will find a path forward. We want to deal with intentional fraudsters, people who are criminally taking advantage of seniors. Members of this House have brought fact patterns to my attention and have said, Please deal with these. This is exactly what we're trying to deal with, Madam Chair.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We will go to Mr. Cannings.", "Mr. Richard Cannings: Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to be sharing my time with the member from EsquimaltSaanichSooke. Tourism is a critical part of the economy throughout my riding, and after struggling with years of forest fires and floods, tourism was set to have a record-breaking year in 2020, but the COVID epidemic has burned tourism to the ground, in the words of a local leader. Thousands of jobs have evaporated. Over half of the tourism businesses in the region are facing imminent insolvency. Many of them are small seasonal operations that don't qualify for any of the government's COVID support programs. While funding for ad campaigns is appreciated, these businesses need direct support and they need certainty about that support. Can the finance minister pledge now to provide direct and timely support to tourism businesses in my riding?", "Hon. Mlanie Joly: Thank you to my colleague for his important question. I agree with him. The tourism sector has been deeply impacted by the pandemic and the economic crisis. Yes, we were looking forward to another record-breaking year in 2020, but unfortunately the pandemic happened, and therefore many businesses were impacted. That's why, as a government, we're there to help with the wage subsidy, which has been extended until the end of August, as the tourism sector has been asking us to do; with the CEBA loans, the $40,000 loans, which also include a subsidy; and with the commercial rent relief. That said, we know the tourism sector also sometimes falls through the cracks. That's why we wanted to have a backstop. We came up with funding through the regional development agencies. In my colleague's riding, it's Western Economic Diversification. Some businesses have applied and have received funding. If there are more that need help, please come and see me. I would love to be there to help your community, help tourism", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We will go to Mr. Cannings.", "Mr. Richard Cannings: A big part of tourism in my riding is the wine sector. One thing that has allowed the wine industry to grow so dramatically in the past few decades is the excise tax exemption. That exemption could likely end very soon if it is found to be non-compliant with our trade agreements. The industry has proposed a trade-legal replacement, the wine growers' value-added program. The finance minister has known about this situation for months. Can he assure this House and the industry that the government will act immediately to implement this program?", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The honourable minister may give a very short answer, please.", "Hon. Bill Morneau: We continue to work on this issue. We recognize how important the wine industry is in B.C., and I assure the honourable member that I will come back to him and give him an update.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Now we will go to Mr. Garrison.", "Mr. Randall Garrison (EsquimaltSaanichSooke, NDP): Madam Chair, this is National Blood Donor Week in Canada. While blood and plasma donations are always important, during this pandemic they're critical. There's a simple and effective way to increase the blood supply: End the gay blood ban. More than 17 other countries have no deferral because they know that behaviour-based screening provides better security for the blood supply than identity-based exclusions. The Liberals must agree, because they promised this in two election campaigns. Will the Minister of Health do more than repeat those same promises today and instead take action to get this unscientific and discriminatory gay blood ban lifted?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos (President of the Treasury Board): Madam Chair, I'm glad to be able to answer this very important question. We indeed want to fight against discrimination. We feel this particularly strongly in the context of the last few days and the last few weeks. We are also mindful of the important contribution of scientists and other experts in this area. We look forward to working with all members in this House in making progress on that issue.", "Mr. Randall Garrison: The government knows I've been calling on friends, family and allies of the gay community to donate blood this week in the place of those of us who cannot. Not only do we need routine blood donations, but to do the research we need on possible prevention and treatment of COVID-19, we urgently need plasma donations from those who have recovered. This ban means that plasma donations are being rejected for no good scientific reason. Again, when will the Minister of Health act to get this ban lifted?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Madam Chair, I think the member used the right key words in referring to science and more prevention work to make sure that everyone lives in dignity and safety. Although there has been progress in the last few months and years on this important issue, there is more work to be done.", "Mr. Randall Garrison: Six years ago this week, I tabled a motion in the House that called for an end to this homophobic and transphobic ban on blood donations from gay men, men who have sex with men and trans women. That was five ministers of health ago. At the time, I was told certain things had to happen before the ban could be lifted. These were all due to be completed earlier this year, before the COVID crisis. Since we appear to have cross-party support for my new motion, M-41, that I put on the notice paper this week, would the minister and the government agree to support a unanimous consent motion to proceed with M-41 immediately?", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The honourable minister may give a short answer, please.", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Thank you, Madam Chair. Homophobia and transphobia are examples of discrimination and absolutely important things not only to recognize but to fight against. That's why we are pleased to have voices such as the member of Parliament's voice to make sure that we make progress in making sure that everyone in Canada lives in safety and in dignity.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr.Blanchette-Joncas.", "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas (Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLes Basques, BQ): MadamChair, I will share my time with the honourable member for LongueuilSaint-Hubert. As Quebec starts to gradually emerge from the general lockdown, the outlook for the recovery of the tourism industry remains bleak. The economy of several regions of Quebec depends on tourism to ensure stability and balance, which will be beneficial in the coming months. Is the Minister of Finance prepared to extend the Canada emergency response benefit beyond 16weeks to ensure a living wage for tourism workers?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: MadamChair, as I said in English, we're working very hard to continue to be there for all Canadians, whether it's through the CERB or the Canada emergency wage subsidy. Please excuse me, I'm very tired. I'll continue in English. We're going to have news on this very soon, Madam Chair, but the point is that we want to make sure that all of these programs work well together, whether it's the wage subsidy or the CERB. We want to make sure that we incentivize work, but we still continue to be there for Canadians.", "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: We read that the government wants to gradually replace the Canada emergency response benefit by using the Canada emergency wage subsidy. That's all well and good, but seasonal industries aren't entitled to it under the current criteria. If the minister is aware of the importance of the tourism industry in the economic cycle of our regions, he must commit to helping workers. If the clientele isn't there, the industry will simply no longer exist. We still need the Canada emergency response benefit. We simply need to make it an employment incentive so as not to hurt people who are lucky enough to be able to go back to work. The question is simple: will the government commit to renewing it?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, we are working hard to make sure we continue to support Canadians as we transition through economic recovery. We want to make sure that we support Canadians, but of course we don't want to disincentivize work. The CERB was created for a different purpose. We asked people to stay home to be safe and to self-isolate if they had symptoms. We want to make sure that as we ask people to go back to work, we don't disincentivize work, but the reality is that there won't be jobs there for everyone, and we need to continue to support everyone.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr.Trudel, you have the floor.", "Mr. Denis Trudel (LongueuilSaint-Hubert, BQ): MadamChair, I join my colleague in extending my good wishes to you on Portugal's national day. Apart from the fact that it is probably the most beautiful riding in Quebec, the riding of LongueuilSaint-Hubert has surely been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, both in terms of health and the economy. There are industries here, but also many service businesses, including bars, restaurants and theatres. But we aren't close to being able to go back and see a show by WajdiMouawad or FredPellerin, and that's a shame. We must work to calm the anxiety of these people. The arts sector was the first to stop its activities and will be the last to resume them. There is a lot of anxiety. The CERB ends on July4. Will the government extend the CERB, with an employment incentive?", "Hon. Steven Guilbeault: MadamChair, I thank my colleague for his question and all the work he's doing in arts and culture. From the outset, we've been there to support our artists and arts organizations. We introduced the Canada emergency response benefit, for example, but also the emergency wage subsidy, which we made available to non-governmental organizations. To ensure that people who receive royalties aren't penalized under the Canada emergency response benefit, we have adapted it. We announced a $500million fund to specifically help the arts and culture sector. In fact, we understand very well that this sector has been severely affected by the current crisis. We've been there for our artists and artisans, and we will continue to be.", "Mr. Denis Trudel: Perfect. Instead of giving a long preamble, I'll ask a very simple question: will the CERB be extended on July5?", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): The hon. minister has the floor.", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Madam Chair, I can assure the member opposite that in July we will be there for Canadian workers.", "Mr. Denis Trudel: In my riding, a nice little restaurant called Crpe Caf on St-Charles Street in Longueuil has just closed its doors. It's final; it won't reopen. Another restaurant owner told me that he was going to reopen his restaurant, but he didn't know at what capacity. Would it be at 15%, 30%, 40%? No one knows. The speed at which the economy will recover is the big unknown. How many hours a week will it be able to offer its employees? Will it be 12hours, 15hours, 22hours? Will employees even want to return to work to put in 12hours a week? If the CERB isn't adjusted, nothing will happen. Will the government commit to extending the CERB and providing an employment incentive to get the economy moving again at full speed?", "Hon. Mlanie Joly: MadamChair, I know, of course, that the restaurant sector has been much affected. I have a great deal of empathy for what entrepreneurs and my colleague are going through in his riding. That's why we are currently helping our SMEs. We have money for economic development. The money is available through Canada Economic Development, or CED. If my colleague wants to work with me to provide support to restaurant owners and other restaurants in Longueuil, I'd be very happy to do so.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We will go to Mr. Bragdon.", "Mr. Richard Bragdon (TobiqueMactaquac, CPC): Madam Chair, last month, on May 5, I asked the government how it plans to support the agriculture sector. The Liberals announced a $50-million food surplus purchase program as part of the agricultural aid package. Now, one month later, our farmers, who provide the food we need, are still waiting on funds to be delivered. The New Brunswick potato industry is sitting on a massive amount of last year's crop that, because of the pandemic, has no buyers. When will the Prime Minister and the government step up and deliver the support our farmers so desperately need?", "Hon. Marco Mendicino: Madam Chair, without question we want to continue to support farmers. My colleague Minister Bibeau has introduced hundreds of millions of dollars for farmers. In addition to that, we have provided relief and support for migrant workers, who are ensuring that Canadians have access to safe and affordable food.", "Mr. Richard Bragdon: Madam Chair, when support for the agriculture sector was announced on May 4, our agriculture sector had been sounding the alarm for weeks that they needed help to continue to meet Canadians' food needs. It has been over a month since that announcement, and our farmers are still waiting for help. It is worth noting, Madam Chair, that vegetables like the potatoes in New Brunswick that I previously mentioned are perishable products. Our farmers do not have the luxury of time. Again, will the Prime Minister and this government make agriculture a priority and provide them with the support they desperately need right now?", "Hon. Mlanie Joly: Madam Chair, obviously we believe in the importance of our regions and our rural communities, and that's why we've always made sure that agriculture was at the core of many of the decisions throughout this pandemic. That's why our colleague Minister Bibeau, who is the Minister of Agriculture, has been there providing the right liquidity and the right support through this pandemic. Of course we want to make sure that we continue to partner with provinces and territories, because we need their help in this context to make sure that all together we show strong economic support for our farmers, who are going through tough times.", "Mr. Richard Bragdon: On May 1 the Liberals introduced a sweeping firearms ban through an order in council that outlawed 1,500 firearms. Recent reports show that since then, more and more firearms are quietly being added to the list of banned firearms, including many common hunting rifles and shotguns. Madam Chair, our hunters, outfitters, dealers and sport shooters are some of the most vetted members of our society. Why does the Prime Minister insist on making criminals out of law-abiding firearms owners instead of dealing with the criminals we already have?", "Hon. Marco Mendicino: Madam Chair, I am very proud of this government's record when it comes to ensuring that we take out of our communities those guns that have one objective only, and that is to kill other people. We will always stand by that record, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to keep our communities safe.", "Mr. Richard Bragdon: Madam Chair, the Liberals have said that to compensate firearms owners, they will implement a national buyback program. Instead of targeting law-abiding firearms owners and their legally purchased private property, wouldn't the estimated quarter of a billion dollars needed to buy back these firearms be better utilized right now in supporting our agricultural sector, the very people who grow our food and literally keep our land?", "Hon. Marco Mendicino: Madam Chair, of course we look forward to saying more about that, but of course we remain committed to taking those guns that have only one objective, and that is to kill people. The legislation we have introduced and the measures we have taken are designed to keep our communities safe, and of course we will do that. We will also continue to support farmers, introducing hundreds of millions of dollars in support because we know they are providing Canadians with affordable food.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Mr. Bragdon, you have time for a short question.", "Mr. Richard Bragdon: Madam Chair, many sole proprietors have been hit extremely hard by this pandemic. My office has heard from many who have been in business for nearly 30 years and have submitted hundreds of HST returns, yet still cannot access the CEBA funding because they do not have a business chequing account, as a lot of small business owners use their personal chequing accounts to do their business. The Liberals offered aid to sole proprietors but attached unnecessary hurdles that prevent many of them from accessing the funds they desperately need to keep their businesses afloat. When will these unnecessary hurdles be removed so businesses can start to receive the relief they so desperately need?", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): We will have a very short answer from the honourable minister.", "Hon. Mlanie Joly: We believe in the importance of making sure we're supporting our businesses, including sole proprietors. That is why our colleague, Minister Ng, the minister for small business, has been working on this and will continue to make sure we take the appropriate steps to recognize that. Meanwhile, people can definitely come to the regional development agencies if they don't have access to funding through banks, and that's a good way to make sure there is a backstop.", "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends): Please note that, pursuant to the Standing Order made on April20 and May26, the House has been recalled. Therefore, the committee will adjourn, and the House will begin sitting at 2:30p.m. The bells will be rung to call members, and a parade will begin the sitting.

Or  Yes , we could things we couldn't extract the  from the data , the hidden variables . Yes , good .

Those are all  And then \" Let 's look at the belief - net \"  OK . So that means that I should switch to the  other program . Um right now it 's still kind of  in a toy  version of it , because we didn't know the probabilities of   or  Well I 'll talk about it when I get the picture up .", "Grad A: No one knows it .", "Grad B: OK . So this right  what we  Let 's see . What happens if I maximize this ? There we go . But uh  So . The mode  basically has three different  outputs .

Basically it 's just the businessman , the tourist , unknown . \" Verb used \" is actually personally amusing mainly because it 's  it 's just whether the verb is a Tango verb , an Enter verb , or a  Vista verb .", "Grad C: Yeah , that one needs a lot of", "Grad D: And are those mutually exclusive sets ?", "Grad B: No .", "Grad C: Not at all . That 's  that  that needs a lot of work .", "Grad D: Right .", "Grad C: But uh   that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter ,", "Grad D: Got it . Uh - huh .", "Grad C: so we decided that for the purposes of this  it 'd be simpler to just have three verbs .", "Grad D: Yeah . Simple .", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Grad D: Stab at it . Yep .", "Grad B: Right . Um  Why don't you mention things about this , Bhaskara , that I am  not  that are not coming to my mind right now .", "Grad C: OK , so  Yeah , so note the four nodes down there , the  sort of , the things that are not directly extracted . Actually , the five things . The \" closed \" is also not directly extracted I guess , from the uh", "Grad B: Well i it 's", "Grad C: Hmm .", "Grad D: From the  utterance ?", "Grad B: it 's so it sort of is", "Grad C: Actually , no , wait .", "Grad B: because it 's  because have the  the time of day", "Grad C: It is . OK , \" closed \" sort of is .", "Grad B: and the close it just had the  er and what time it closed .", "Grad C: Right , so f Right , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , that kind of thing is all uh  sort of  you know probabilistically depends on the other things .", "Grad D: Inferred from the other ones ?", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad D: OK .", "Grad C: And the mode , you know , depends on all those things only .", "Grad B: Yeah the   the actual parse is somewhere up around in here .", "Grad C: Yeah . So we haven't uh , managed  Like we don't have nodes for \" discourse \" and \" parse \" , although like in some sense they are parts of this belief - net .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: But uh   The idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse ,", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad C: because we 'd never do inference on it anyway , so .", "Grad D: So some of the  the top row of things  What 's  what 's \" Disc admission fee \" ?", "Grad C: whether they discuss the admission fees . So we looked at the data and in a lot of data people were saying things like  \" Can I get to this place ? \"", "Grad D: Oh .", "Grad C: \" What is the admission fee ? \" . So that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to Enter the place rather than uh to Tango or Vista ,", "Grad D: Uh - huh .", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad D: OK .", "Grad C: so .", "Grad D: I see .", "Grad B: There were  there 'd be other things besides just the admission fee , but  you know ,  we didn't have", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: That was like our example .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: That was the  initial one that we found .", "Grad D: OK . So there are certain cues that are very strong  either lexical or topic - based um , concept cues", "Grad B: From the discourse that  Yeah .", "Grad D: for one of those . And then in that second row  or whatever that row of Time of Day through that  So all of those  Some of them come from the utterance and some of them are sort of  either world knowledge or situational  things .", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad D: Right ? So that you have no distinction between those and OK .", "Grad B: One , uh  Uh .  Um , anything else you want to say Bhaskara ?", "Grad C: Um .", "Grad D: \" Unmark @ @ Time of Day \"", "Grad C: Yeah , I m I mean", "Grad A: Yeah . They 're  they 're are a couple of more things .", "Grad B: One thing  uh", "Grad A: I mean Uh . I would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we  we all uh , agree on what  what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe  what changes we", "Grad B: Yeah , th OK . so one thing I  I 'm you know unsure about , is how we have the discus uh  the \" admission fee \" thing set up . So one  thing that we were thinking was  by doing the layers like this , Uh  we kept um  things from directly affecting the mode  beyond the concept , but you could see perhaps discus the \" admission fee \" going directly to the mode pointing at \" Enter \" ,", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: right ? Versus pointing to just at \" tourist \" ,", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: OK ?", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: But we just decided to keep all the things we extracted  to point at the middle and then  down .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .

So then landmark is  Oh , sorry . \" Verb used \" is like , right now we only have three values , but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: Rather , let me rephrase that .

Yeah .", "Marketing: and then use the telly as a screen .", "Project Manager: Right .", "Marketing: But um", "User Interface: I'm thinking kind of", "Marketing: But yeah for sure .

Mm .", "User Interface: Or like you h you see those you know people  I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those  these things that at their house you know  their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that  and it's like a hand held like  turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like  so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if  it must be  it would probably", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .", "User Interface: Yeah , yeah .

Right .", "PhD D: And Pratibha did something different is that he  uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance  by computing  this on the  twenty - five first frames of each utterance .

Any - anyway go ahead .", "PhD D: Yeah . So uh what we were thinking about is perhaps  um one way  to solve this problem is increase the number of  outputs of the neural networks . Doing something like , um  um phonemes within context and , well , basically context dependent phonemes .", "Professor B: Maybe . I mean , I  I think  you could make  the same argument , it 'd be just as legitimate ,  for hybrid systems  as well . Right .", "PhD D: Yeah but , we know that", "Professor B: And in fact ,  th things get better with context dependent  versions . Right ?", "PhD D: Ye - yeah but here it 's something different . We want to have features", "Professor B: Yeah .", "PhD D: uh well ,  um .", "Professor B: Yeah , but it 's still true  that what you 're doing  is you 're ignoring  you 're  you 're coming up with something to represent ,  whether it 's a distribution ,  probability distribution or features , you 're coming up with a set of variables  that are representing  uh ,  things that vary w over context .", "PhD D: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: Uh , and you 're  putting it all together , ignoring the differences in context . That  that 's true  for the hybrid system , it 's true for a tandem system . So , for that reason , when you  in  in  in a hybrid system ,  when you incorporate context one way or another ,  you do get better scores .", "PhD D: Yeah .", "Professor B: OK ? But I  it 's  it 's a big deal  to get that . I  I 'm  I 'm sort of  And once you  the other thing is that once you represent  start representing more and more context  it is  uh  much more  um specific  to a particular task in language . So um Uh , the   the acoustics associated with  uh a particular context , for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur  in one language and will occur frequently in the other , so the qu the issue of getting enough training  for a particular kind of context becomes harder . We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data um", "PhD D: Yeah , but  mmm , I mean ,  the  the way we  we do it now is that we have a neural network and  basically  the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions .", "Professor B: Right .", "PhD D: And  uh  binary decisions about phonemes . Nnn  Uh It 's", "Professor B: Almost . But I mean it  it  it does give a distribution .", "PhD D: Yeah .", "Professor B: It 's  and  and  it is true that if there 's two phones that are very similar ,  that  uh  the   i it may prefer one but it will  give a reasonably high value to the other , too .", "PhD D: Yeah . Yeah , sure but uh  So basically it 's almost binary decisions and  um the idea of using more  classes is  to  get something that 's  less binary decisions .", "Professor B: Oh no , but it would still be even more of a binary decision .

I actually would have thought you 'd wanna go the other way and have fewer classes .", "PhD D: Yeah , but if", "Professor B: Uh , I mean for instance , the  the thing I was arguing for before , but again which I don't think we have time to try ,  is something in which you would modify the code so you could train to have several outputs on and use articulatory features", "PhD D: Mmm . Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: cuz then that would  that would go   that would be much broader and cover many different situations .

Yeah , but I think  Yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so  you  you have more information in your features .

Are we gonna look at combinations of things ? Uh , what questions are we gonna ask , uh now that , I mean ,  we should probably turn shortly to this O G I note .

And  we  plan to work also on the idea of using both  features  and net outputs .", "PhD D: Um . And  we think that  with this approach perhaps  we could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network . Um , So , get simpler networks , because we still have the features .

I see , OK .", "PhD D: yeah . So it 's  Well , it 's basically a standard net with fewer  classes .", "Professor B: So you 're sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago instead of  yeah .", "PhD D: Yeah , but I think  Yeah . B b including the features , yeah .", "Grad F: But including the features .", "PhD E: Yeah .", "PhD D: I don't think this  will work  alone . I think it will get worse because Well , I believe the effect that  of  of too reducing too much the information is  basically  basically what happens", "Professor B: Uh - huh .", "PhD D: and", "Professor B: But you think if you include that  plus the other features ,", "PhD D: but  Yeah , because  there is perhaps one important thing that the net  brings , and OGI show showed that , is  the distinction between  sp speech and silence Because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition .

OK , we have  lots of them .", "PhD E: We have one .", "Professor B: OK , so  um , Something I asked  So they 're  they 're doing  the  the VAD I guess they mean voice activity detection So again , it 's the silence  So they 've just trained up a net  which has two outputs , I believe .

OK .", "Professor B: I think this was   I think this is the same point we were at when  when we were up in Oregon .", "PhD E: Yeah .", "PhD D: I think   I think it 's the C - zero  using C - zero instead of log energy .", "PhD E: Ah , OK , mm - hmm .", "PhD D: Yeah , it 's this .", "Professor B: Oh . OK .", "PhD E: yeah .", "PhD D: It should be that , yeah .", "PhD A: They s they say in here that the VAD is not used as an additional feature .", "Professor B: Shouldn't it be", "PhD D: Because", "PhD A: Does  does anybody know how they 're using it ?", "Professor B: Yeah . So  so what they 're doing here is ,  i", "PhD D: Yeah .", "Professor B: if you look down at the block diagram ,  um ,  they estimate  they get a   they get an estimate  of whether it 's speech or silence ,", "PhD A: But that", "Professor B: and then they have a median filter of it .", "PhD A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: And so um ,  basically they 're trying to find stretches . The median filter is enforcing a  i it having some continuity .", "PhD A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: You find stretches where the  combination of the  frame wise VAD and the   the median filter say that there 's a stretch of silence .

Before", "Professor B: It 's throwing out chunks of frames , yeah . There 's  the  the median filter is enforcing that it 's not gonna be single cases of frames , or isolated frames .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor B: So it 's throwing out frames and the thing is  um ,  what I don't understand is how they 're doing this with H T", "PhD A: Yeah , that 's what I was just gonna ask .", "Professor B: This is", "PhD A: How can you just throw out frames ?", "Professor B: Yeah . Well , you  you can ,", "PhD D: i", "Professor B: right ? I mean y you  you", "PhD D: Yeah .", "Professor B: it stretches again .

Yeah , you can basically remove the  the frames from the feature  feature files .", "Professor B: Yeah . Yeah , so I mean in the  i i in the  in the decoding , you 're saying that we 're gonna decode from here to here .", "PhD D: I t", "PhD A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: I think they 're  they 're  they 're treating it ,  you know , like uh  well , it 's not isolated word , but  but connected , you know , the  the", "PhD A: In the text they say that this  this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of . So that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet .", "Professor B: Well .  No they  they have numbers though , right ? So I think they 're  they 're doing something like that . I think that they 're  they 're  I think what I mean by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that 's plausible for the standard . In other words , it 's  uh  I mean from the point of view of  of uh reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it 's not a bad idea to detect silence anyway .", "PhD A: Yeah . Yeah . I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this .", "Professor B: Um . But it 's  the thing is it 's that  that  that 's  that 's I  I  Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice ,  uh uh for listening to , is that these kinds of things  uh cut  speech off a lot .", "PhD A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: Right ? And so  um", "PhD A: Plus it 's gonna introduce delays .", "Professor B: It does introduce delays but they 're claiming that it 's  it 's within the   the boundaries of it .", "PhD A: Mmm .", "Professor B: And the LDA introduces delays , and b  what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it doesn't introduce  uh , any more delay . I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same  time the LDA  down here  I don't know  Wh what 's the difference between TLDA and SLDA ?", "PhD C: Temporal and spectral .", "Professor B: Ah , thank you .", "PhD E: Temporal LDA .", "Professor B: Yeah , you would know that .", "PhD C: Yeah", "Professor B: So um . The temporal LDA does in fact include the same  so that  I think he  well , by  by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means  if you construct it this way , this  this delay would work in that way", "PhD A: Ah .", "Professor B: and then it 'd be OK . They  they clearly did actually remove  silent sections in order  because they  got these  word error rate  results . So um I think that it 's  it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gonna give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation . Whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard , I don't know . Um . Uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the  word models are pretty bad and nobody wants   has  has approached improving them . So  it 's possible that a lot of the problems  with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models  to begin with . So  this might just be a temporary thing . But  But , on the other hand , and maybe  maybe it 's a decent idea . So um The question we 're gonna wanna go  through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been  if you look at what we 've been trying , we 're uh looking at  uh , by then I guess , combinations of features and multi - band Uh , and we 've been looking at  cross - language , cross  task  issues . And they 've been not so much looking at  the cross task uh multiple language issues . But they 've been looking at uh   at these issues . At the on - line normalization and the uh  voice activity detection . And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about  um what do we choose  from what we 've looked at  to um blend with  some group of things in what they 've looked at And once we choose that ,  how do we split up the  effort ? Uh , because we still have  even once we choose ,  we 've still got  uh another  month or so , I mean there 's holidays in the way , but  but uh  I think the evaluation data comes January thirty - first so there 's still a fair amount of time  to do things together it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites  in that  that amount of time .", "PhD A: When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's   knows when it 's time to back trace or something ?", "Professor B: Well , see they , I  I think they 're Um . I don't know the   the specifics of how they 're doing it . They 're   they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to  um , change the scripts  for the recognizer ,  I believe .", "PhD A: Oh , right . Maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something ?", "Professor B: So . Uh . Uh , you know that 's what I had thought . But I don't  I don't think they are .", "PhD A: Hmm .", "Professor B: I mean that 's  sort of what  the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side , yeah you p put some low level noise or something . Probably don't want all zeros .", "PhD A: Hmm .", "Professor B: Most recognizers don't like zeros but  but  you know ,  put some epsilon in or some rand", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor B: sorry epsilon random variable  in or something .", "PhD A: Some constant vector . I mean i w Or something", "Professor B: Maybe not a constant but it doesn't , uh  don't like to divide by the variance of that , but I mean it 's", "PhD A: That 's right . But something that  what I mean is something that is  very distinguishable from  speech .", "Professor B: Mm - hmm .", "PhD A: So that the  the silence model in HTK will always pick it up .", "Professor B: Yeah . So I  I  that 's what I thought they would do . or else , uh  uh maybe there is some indicator to tell it to start and stop , I don't know .", "PhD A: Hmm .", "Professor B: But whatever they did , I mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor B: We c we can find out .", "PhD A: Cuz you gotta do something . Otherwise , if it 's just a bunch of speech , stuck together", "Professor B: No they 're", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor B: It would do badly", "PhD A: Yeah , right .", "Professor B: and it didn't so badly , right ? So they did something .", "PhD A: Yeah , yeah .", "Professor B: Yeah . Uh . So , OK , So I think  this brings me up to date a bit . It hopefully brings other  people up to date a bit . And um Um  I think  Uh , I wanna look at these numbers off - line a little bit and think about it and   and talk with everybody uh ,  outside of this meeting . Um , but uh No I mean it sounds like  I mean  there  there  there are the usual number of  of  little  little problems and bugs and so forth but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out . And now we 're  seem to be kind of in a position to actually  uh ,  look at stuff and  and  and compare things . So I think that 's  that 's pretty good . Um  I don't know what the  One of the things I wonder about ,  coming back to the first results you talked about , is  is  how much ,  uh  things could be helped  by more parameters . And uh   And uh how many more parameters we can afford to have ,   in terms of the uh computational limits .

It 's got s slots for eight , uh IBM was donating five , I think we only got two so far , processors . We had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors . They ended up being five fifty . So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two  that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . And more are supposed to come soon and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory . So I don't think  anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to  spend much time  uh  with it , but uh  Hopefully ,  they 'll get us some more  parts , soon and  Uh , yeah , I think that 'll be  once we get it populated ,  that 'll be a nice machine .

There 's  there 's  there 's gonna be debugging hassles and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight , to have it really be useful . But .

Maybe uh you've got new information ,  like uh last time .", "Project Manager: Uh I didn't  No no . I do hot have  Only the same information .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Hello , Sebastian .", "Industrial Designer: Hello hello Mister P_M_ .", "Project Manager: I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room .", "Industrial Designer: Well , that's where the thinking goes on .", "Project Manager: Oh , it's that Roo again , always late .", "User Interface: Bongiorno .", "Project Manager: Bongiorno .", "Industrial Designer: I think you should punish him .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: You're the P_M_ .", "User Interface: Punish .", "Project Manager: I see some interesting", "Project Manager: okay .", "User Interface: You wish .", "Industrial Designer: Possibilities , yeah ?", "Project Manager: People , welcome back .", "User Interface: Welcome .

Um  first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: so I could  uh can uh um use that in the in the report .  Um the second thing , um  I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . That's quite strange .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: Okay . We'll come to that later , I g I think .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: Um  the agenda for now  uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?", "User Interface: No .", "Industrial Designer: Not at all .", "Project Manager: Okay . Um", "Marketing: No .", "Project Manager: we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um  I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .", "Marketing: 'Kay . Hmm ?", "User Interface: Alright .", "Marketing: Oh .", "Marketing: .", "Industrial Designer: Just press the okay button , it works .", "Marketing: Yeah ,   Okay .", "Project Manager: Um yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah . My method ?", "Industrial Designer: How surprising .", "Marketing: Well , findings . Uh  Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,", "Marketing: and that they want spongy material . Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .", "Marketing: Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes  uh m material . But we  since we are concentrating on uh the younger group", "Project Manager: Uh w wait a sec wait a se", "Industrial Designer: Oh wait uh wait up .", "Project Manager: uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes", "Marketing: 'Kay .", "Project Manager: Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah  okay . The feel of  to be spongy", "Industrial Designer: Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?", "Marketing: Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .", "Industrial Designer: Not something dull .", "User Interface: But they like dark colours ,", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: you said in the p", "Marketing: No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects .", "User Interface: Okay . Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow .", "Marketing: But", "User Interface: I had", "Industrial Designer: But can you can you go back to that slide ? The  uh", "Marketing: Which one ?", "Industrial Designer: just one slide back ,", "Marketing: This ?", "Industrial Designer: no no no . Yes . Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .", "Marketing: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ?", "Marketing: Uh well , it might .", "Marketing: But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But  Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .", "Project Manager: Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it  maybe it rubber or or", "Marketing: Yeah , exactly .", "Project Manager: yeah .  Okay .", "Marketing: Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials ,", "User Interface: Or we could make  oh .", "Marketing: but that doesn't mean we should use wood , So", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .", "Project Manager: Well , that's interesting .", "Industrial Designer: It's quite interesting .", "Project Manager: You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .", "User Interface: Yeah , o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh  telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: Yeah , yeah .", "User Interface: It's the it's the rubber uh cover .", "Project Manager: Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .", "User Interface: And it's uh colourful .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: It looks likes a banana .  We have the fruit , we have the colours .  We have the simple design .", "Project Manager: Do you know the phone ?", "Industrial Designer: I don't know the phone ,", "Project Manager: It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five ,", "Industrial Designer: but I can imagine it .", "Project Manager: I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away ,", "User Interface: Um thirty five .", "Industrial Designer: Oh , that one , yes .", "Project Manager: the very", "User Interface: And the b the light blue and  it's also in yellow .", "Industrial Designer: Now I kn uh  oh , I know , I know . Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .", "Project Manager: You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th", "Marketing: I've seen it ,", "Project Manager: Okay . Okay . Um uh", "Marketing: but", "Project Manager: okay . Do you have   uh thit  that was", "Marketing: 'Kay . Uh that's about it .", "Project Manager: Okay .  Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the  our target group .", "Marketing: Yes .", "Project Manager: And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .", "Marketing: Uh soft material .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So  So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?", "Marketing: Uh the fancy look and feel .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .", "Marketing: Yes . Apparently .", "Project Manager: Okay , Roo ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: could you do your presentation ?", "User Interface: Mm-hmm . Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um", "Project Manager: Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .", "User Interface: Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and  just um , well , a weird um shape .", "Project Manager: Shape .", "User Interface: So I suggest  I couldn't uh  I had a small uh mock-up uh  sign on the  on  paper .", "User Interface: But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple  f uh a shape on uh  in um PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um  I mean this is how you hold a remote control .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,", "Industrial Designer: Slippery .", "Project Manager: s because um", "User Interface: But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .", "Industrial Designer: You have to grab it .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah , exactly .", "User Interface: So it's easy in your hand  Uh indeed .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,", "Project Manager: Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier .", "Project Manager: Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: So m Yes .", "Project Manager: okay .", "Industrial Designer: But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .", "Project Manager: Okay , good .", "User Interface: Great .", "User Interface: Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: yeah .", "User Interface: So if you have the voice recognition , you can  you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .", "Project Manager: Okay , b but I think we'll", "Industrial Designer: Okay , but I'll I'll go into that ,", "Project Manager: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a  it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing .  We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .", "User Interface: Yeah . Right .", "Industrial Designer: But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source  source . Which brings me to the different energy sources .  Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh  remote controls .", "Industrial Designer: You really have to imagine like  winding up your  uh", "User Interface: Great .", "Project Manager: Well , it would be very new to the market ,", "Industrial Designer: I d", "Project Manager: but", "Industrial Designer: It would be very new ,", "Industrial Designer: but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Uh   Well ,", "Industrial Designer: this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching TV uh or when you're  you you have to um make some kind of energy  kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .", "User Interface: Like the watch .", "Industrial Designer: It have  it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing .", "Project Manager: I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . It's very funny indeed .", "Project Manager: I mean solar is  of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Indeed .", "Project Manager: Um hand dynamo", "User Interface: But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and", "Project Manager: Well , maybe m", "User Interface: if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I know .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yes .", "User Interface: You you walk", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: and uh  but uh you  you're sitting on a couch .", "Industrial Designer: But you know you know from your own watch  your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy .  the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a  in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,", "Project Manager: Yeah . And wha", "Industrial Designer: well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So , but maybe  maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .", "Project Manager: Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .", "Industrial Designer: Uh yes , it does .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I'll come to that later .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .  The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . Um  uh in the indicators we have the LCD displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four", "User Interface: Mm-hmm . Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . That is possible too . Yes .", "User Interface: But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels  I had some  I had some information about it too .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: I don't think  there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .", "Project Manager: Well", "User Interface: I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .", "Industrial Designer: Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .", "Project Manager: This will be the remote , right ?", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?", "User Interface: Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,", "Industrial Designer: Uh it's do it's done before .", "Project Manager: Because this is how you keep it", "User Interface: but", "Industrial Designer: Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .", "User Interface: But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for", "Project Manager: Volume ?", "Industrial Designer: Well , it's it  well , i what he means is there's an  button integrated in the scroll-wheel .", "User Interface: A volume , okay .", "Industrial Designer: There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .", "Project Manager: Well , what about mute ?", "Industrial Designer: About mute .", "Project Manager: Thi i i m I guess uh th", "Industrial Designer: Well , yes .", "Project Manager: this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Yes . Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .", "Project Manager: And click it to muten the device .", "Industrial Designer: Well , okay . It's quite goods .", "Project Manager: And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yes .", "Project Manager: So maybe um  I guess that  that's something you two uh need to think about .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .", "Marketing: Um   Uh well ,", "User Interface: Wheel .", "Marketing: it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .  But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And  Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .", "Project Manager: Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .", "Industrial Designer: So maybe it's not no  .", "Project Manager: Nokia has a  well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .", "Project Manager: Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: It doesn't use a   . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here .", "Project Manager: For you too , yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .", "Industrial Designer: Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .", "User Interface: So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .  yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay . Sebastian . Um", "Industrial Designer: Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate LCD displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: There's  there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation .  About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .", "User Interface: Yeah yeah , you can um  I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word  you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So  so", "User Interface: Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function", "Industrial Designer: okay .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yeah .", "User Interface: and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: and then it's um  well , I believe it's uh", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: It performs the action . Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what  which he believes it is .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So you say mute , he repeats mute and you  makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the LCD display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .", "Project Manager: Okay . Uh well  uh", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: d did we already decide on the display ? To", "Industrial Designer: Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about .", "User Interface: Yeah . Well , I don't have um  I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information  uh y I don't think you need it on a display .", "Project Manager: No .", "User Interface: Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh", "Industrial Designer: I I don't think either .", "User Interface: 'cause uh  uh all  any TV can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,", "Industrial Designer: No . I don't think you need it .", "Project Manager: On screen display . Yeah .", "User Interface: yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay , well", "Project Manager: th", "Industrial Designer: my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the  a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper .", "Project Manager: Okay . Good .", "Industrial Designer: So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing .", "Project Manager: Kineti okay .", "Industrial Designer: The kinetic thing it  it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm  I think you should combine it with batteries .", "Project Manager: Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,", "Industrial Designer: Otherwise it will not  too advanced ,", "Project Manager: too", "Industrial Designer: uh well .", "Project Manager: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: It's  in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but that  that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .", "Industrial Designer: But  Yes . And I think it's more robust .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: It's more uh Uh it's more functional .", "User Interface: But what about um the markets  uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium", "Project Manager: No no , but the uh um  that's what Sebastian said .", "Industrial Designer: The titanium thing uh we have to skip it .", "Project Manager: He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different .", "User Interface: Okay . Oh ,", "Project Manager: So um", "User Interface: sorry . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and we should uh use wood or something like that .", "Project Manager: No ,", "User Interface: And I would think", "Marketing: And", "Project Manager: r", "Marketing: yeah ,", "Project Manager: rubber with colours .", "Marketing: the  yeah , the older people liked wood .", "Industrial Designer: Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber .", "Marketing: No the", "Project Manager: Colourful and", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , spongy materials .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy .", "User Interface: And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?", "Industrial Designer: So  Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple", "User Interface: Okay , but we also  uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker", "Industrial Designer: Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh  a different", "User Interface: oh ,", "Project Manager: But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,", "User Interface: evalu", "Project Manager: or", "Industrial Designer: I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .", "Project Manager: I it's too dull . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I don't think c our customers will like it .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot  um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So I think this is the best of two worlds .", "Project Manager: Okay , what about um  the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour", "Industrial Designer: Yes . It's it's  uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: It's very unlogical .", "User Interface: But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .", "Project Manager: Well", "Industrial Designer: Well the there has to be some pointing at . But", "Project Manager: It depends also on your on your", "User Interface: Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just  to the other wall .", "Project Manager: Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably  you're probably right .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um  yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .", "Industrial Designer: All lights get absorbed , yeah .", "Project Manager: So", "Industrial Designer: Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So  it has an  it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .", "User Interface: And the regular chip .", "Industrial Designer: I think uh it gives us the advantage of", "User Interface: And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes , yes .", "Project Manager: I like the scroll wheels uh idea .", "Industrial Designer: And uh skip  and skip the LCD part .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I don't think it it's any uh value added thing .", "User Interface: No . Think so too .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: Well , it looks  uh yeah , well um", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,", "Industrial Designer: Technology .", "Project Manager: and I mean LCD is", "Industrial Designer: Yes . It's not very flashy and new .", "Project Manager: well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard", "Marketing: Standard ?", "Project Manager: than than  Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part .

{"meeting_id": "m_test_13", "domain": "committee", "meeting_transcripts": ["Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David and there is no substitute. Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2, then, is a further evidence session, number four, on our inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. I'm very pleased to welcome Dafydd Evans, who is chair, ColegauCymru, and chief executive officer of Gr\u0175p Llandrillo Menai; Kay Martin, principal of Cardiff and Vale College, also representing ColegauCymru; Nick Brazil, who is deputy principal, Gower College Swansea, also representing ColegauCymru; Dr Rachel Bowen, director of policy and development at ColegauCymru; and Ed Evans, who is the director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association. Thank you all for attending. We're very pleased that you've been able to join us. If it's okay with you, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Good morning. I'll be asking my questions in Welsh.", "Dafydd Evans: Could I start and then open it up? Thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence. But just to give you the context, I think, if you were asking about the vast majority of subjects what the view of ColegauCymru\u00a0would be, it would be quite unanimous, but I think on the Welsh bac\u00a0there is a difference of opinion, and I'm sure you'll hear those differences on the panel before you today. We've possibly chosen this panel because there are differences of opinion. So, I just want to give you that context at the outset. To answer the specific question, no, I don't think that employers have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac\u00a0means or what it includes. Personally I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac\u00a0is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I think the skills challenge certificate is a better title, and is something that people understand a lot better than the Welsh bac. So, no, I don't think that employers understand the value or what we're trying to achieve through the Welsh bac\u00a0at present.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Which is a big problem.", "Dafydd Evans: Yes, it's a huge problem, but not only to employers, but also to parents and young people, of course.", "Dr Rachel Bowen: And I think that that varies by size of employer as well. That, certainly, where there are larger employers, who've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum, they may have more capacity to follow changes, get up to date with how Welsh education is evolving. But we know that most employers in Wales are small or microbusinesses. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine.", "Nick Brazil: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues\u00a0within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly\u00a0meet with\u2014employers\u2014and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require\u2014the Welsh bac\u2014to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within\u00a0those professional sectors. Not many of them have indicated that the Welsh bac is providing the skills that they require. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac\u00a0initially, but the Welsh bac\u00a0has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the\u00a0year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable. And, as I said, from the employer boards that we have, very few of them understand\u00a0the Welsh bac. They certainly don't mention the Welsh bac and, as I said, are very much questioning the qualifications\u00a0that have been provided to develop the actual professional skills needed within the industries.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Kay, is that your experience?", "Kay Martin: Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications.\u00a0But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they\u00a0want them to be literate, numerate, and they want them to have digital skills. And that isn't captured necessarily in the Welsh baccalaureate. And, so, the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And, finally, I know you've got strong views as an organisation.", "Ed Evans: Do you mind if I carry on in English\u2014", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Fine.", "Ed Evans: \u2014just so that a lot of our members will understand when I'm speaking. I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. For my sector in particular\u2014the civil engineering sector\u2014and particularly the\u00a0contracting sector, which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background, the Welsh bac gives them that ability, I guess, not to pursue so much of an academic focus, but to test them in terms of the challenges, but also, to\u2014. And I think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this, and\u00a0supporting schools and colleges to deliver it, they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry. And some children, some pupils, some young people, they respond far, far better to that. And I think that's the issue for me\u2014that we've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. All of my understanding of this is literally as a parent, and that would\u00a0be true of a lot of employers as well. So, perhaps there are differences across the sector, but I think, certainly for my sector, we would really value the growth of the Welsh baccalaureate.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: What are we going to do, then, to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while, if you feel that it is worth while, of course?", "Dafydd Evans: I think we need to review the qualification, and I think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within\u00a0that qualification. And I think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications\u00a0board, I think\u00a0the employers\u2014. And the only way we'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what's being done. Because I think that's what the\u00a0vision was for the Welsh baccalaureate\u2014that it was going to improve skills for employment. But, somehow or other we've lost our way. The aim is an excellent one, but I think we've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day, and I think having more input from employers would be a great help.", "Ed Evans: I will carry on in English, if that's okay.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, it's no problem.", "Ed Evans: I would agree. I think we do need more employers involved in this. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in\u00a0my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. It happens at the moment. It's the community benefits clauses that are in construction contracts. They're there to serve a really good purpose, but it's become a little bit piecemeal and a little bit tokenistic, whereas the Welsh bac offers an opportunity\u2014. It's something that's part of the curriculum. It's clearly not functioning well at the moment. It would benefit from that business input. So, why not link up those contractual clauses, which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools so that we have a far more\u00a0structured way of getting employers into schools? At the moment it's a little bit\u2014we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic. We need to be far more clever in terms of how we\u00a0join these things up, and then I think you'll start to get that business input there, but let's not be ad hoc about it.", "Kay Martin: Could I just add something? We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days\u2014they go for six-week internships. Some learners have got real benefit from that and really raised their aspirations. We've got BTEC learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with Freshfields law in London, which is one of the top law firms in the world. So, there are lots of other programmes as well, and perhaps there's a way of joining it all up together. But, in the college, we've got several different programmes going on with employers and the Welsh bac is one of them, but it's not the one that engages employers the best, certainly in our college.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: So, do we get rid of it?", "Lynne Neagle AM: You don't need to answer that. [Laughter.]", "Sian Gwenllian AM: I mean, if there are so many other programmes helping anyway, why do we need it?", "Nick Brazil: I think that is a very good question, but I will go back to Ed's point, which I think was a very important point, which is that the initial vision for the Welsh bac\u2014I think when we go back a number of years\u2014was a really good, good vision for the Welsh bac. It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. And that's what happens, unfortunately. But I think what Ed said is absolutely right: if you get the engagement of the employers\u2014. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. The actual progress of learners into employment is happening. So, I think the question is: have we got programmes already in place, and do we need another one on top? But the vision initially for the Welsh bac, as I said, I will always be positive about. The vision was a good one.", "Dafydd Evans: I'd like to expand on what Nick said. It's important for you to understand that although we always try and put the learner first, funding does drive behaviours, and the Welsh bac is fundable; Career Ready isn't. So, yes, there are options out there, but because we're so focused on qualifications and we will only fund qualifications, that drives certain behaviours, and\u00a0I think you need as a committee to be very much aware of that.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you've got a supplementary.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes, but that was very useful information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said\u2014that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills.\u00a0However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools\u2014well, and indeed colleges\u2014might be tempted to go for it. So, thank you for that. Diolch.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Have you finished? Janet.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Good morning. What are your views on how well the Welsh bac, at all levels, helps to prepare learners for employment? We've spoken to quite a few learners, and again we've had variable opinions coming back, so it's quite how they, from their perspective\u2014.", "Dafydd Evans: I think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities. And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs\u2014in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a\u00a0C grade in the core subjects. But that eats into the time that we have to teach young people. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow\u2014no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. So, the priorities, I think, across the sector\u2014. We've given priority to GCSE\u00a0resits\u00a0rather than doing the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. So, at levels 1 and 2, there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they're resitting their GCSEs, and there is much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. Thank you.", "Nick Brazil: Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh bac is a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification\u2014it's a combination. So, to develop the employability skills obviously is a key part, and developing the skills for employment is a key part. But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac\u2014for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well\u2014that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes\u2014and we all get funded on the outcomes\u2014that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability. So, I think people lose the fact that the Welsh bac is a combination of things. And I think it was interesting, the comment that was made about the Duke of Edinburgh\u2014I thought that's something that we need to think about.", "Kay Martin: If I could just say as well, our job in the college is to develop skills and employable people, and we use every tool in our box to do that. And, as I said earlier, there are lots of things that we do. The Welsh bac, where it works really well, does help prepare them, I think, for employment, but it's not for everyone, because some people have to do the other things. Some people doing the equivalent of three A-levels, even in a vocational programme, it's too big for them. As you say, they're coming from schools, some of them with very few GCSEs, or they haven't got literacy and numeracy skills, they're being tested and many of them are below level 1 in terms of literacy and numeracy. So, I think it needs to be reviewed, to look at how we could make skilled and employable people. It helps prepare some people\u2014the A-level students for university\u2014but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.", "Dr Rachel Bowen: And this, ultimately, has to be about what's in the best interests of learners, and a one-size-fits-all approach isn't going to work.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Is there a difference in how the Welsh bac is valued by learners at the different levels that it is studied? ColegauCymru said that learners may have had a negative experience of the Welsh bac in previous study.", "Dafydd Evans: That's been a new dimension lately, I think, in that, when the Welsh bac first hit FE, we were leading the way\u2014", "Kay Martin: Great advocates.", "Dafydd Evans: \u2014and great advocates. By now, of course, they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then\u2014'Oh, we've done this at school already. Why are we doing it again at college?' So, I think that's a problem for us as well.", "Kay Martin: Many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity. So, at level 1 and level 2, it's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges,\u00a0but at level 3 it's more, especially for A-levels, because it can help them get into university, but even for the more able and talented\u2014we were discussing this, weren't we? We have learners who do four A-levels, but they don't do the Welsh baccalaureate because they're part of the Seren network, and they are going to be applying for Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. So, the Welsh bac, although it's technically universally adopted by universities, it isn't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university. So, to get into some areas, like dentistry, for example, and some of the other Seren-type activities, four A-levels is better. But in most colleges that\u00a0have A-level students it's almost compulsory to do the Welsh bac as well, but normally that would be three A-levels and the Welsh bac\u2014normally.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And then ColegauCymru say that, increasingly, the Welsh bac is not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level. So, are the different levels of the Welsh bac valued differently by further education professionals?", "Nick Brazil: Yes.", "Kay Martin: Yes.", "Dafydd Evans: Yes.", "Dr Rachel Bowen: Yes.", "Ed Evans: Yes.", "Nick Brazil: I think we've got to bear in mind when the students come to us\u2014certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners\u2014that a number of them have come from school and\u00a0probably not done as well as they'd hoped at their GCSEs. Okay, they've come to us, they're trying to build themselves back up, build their skills back up, and adding another qualification on top, adding the Welsh bac on top, whether that's foundation or national, on top of what they have to do, which is a programme they've come and decided to do\u2014think of the pressure that increases upon them. Plus the fact is that they are resitting; they're probably having to resit GCSE English and maths as well. That's a huge volume of work for a learner who's probably come from a\u00a0low base to begin with and who hasn't achieved what they wanted to. The whole idea when we bring them in at that level is that we want to build their confidence, build them up and, hopefully, eventually they will go to the stage where maybe the Welsh bac will be beneficial to them, when they've potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. But I think it's questionable, certainly at national and foundation. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.' They want to see some difference, they want to see some progress, and that's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels.", "Dr Rachel Bowen: And we know that delivery in schools is of variable quality, so obviously that impacts on how learners have experienced it and perhaps how they view it when they get to FE college.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay.\u00a0A question, then, just to ColegauCymru: to what extent do you believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh bac?", "Kay Martin: Well, we don't think they do, really, especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to Russell Group universities. They do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade. I talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a Russell Group university because she had the Welsh bac as well, but it was a very paper-based exercise. But I think it is mixed, and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they're going into in universities. In some areas, and certainly the local universities around here\u2014University of South Wales, Cardiff Metropolitan University\u2014value it in a great number of subjects, particularly in sport, when our students go to Cardiff Met, and business studies, when our learners go to USW. It is valued by them and they accept it, but when people go further afield\u2014and we're always trying to push our learners beyond. Where they can afford to go away to university, we encourage that. But some of the universities are not valuing the Welsh baccalaureate.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Did you have a supplementary, Si\u00e2n?", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. You didn't mention Cardiff University there.", "Kay Martin: Cardiff University\u2014yes. My daughter's example\u2014that was Cardiff University. So, they do, especially now it's graded at level 3. Then they do accept it. A great number of our learners get into Cardiff using the Welsh baccalaureate, but would their admissions tutors prefer four A-levels? Absolutely.", "Nick Brazil: Could I jump in there? I've got to jump in there as, from the institution I'm in, we've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. About 20 per cent of our learners go to Russell Group universities, and there is no doubt\u2014in certainly 50 per cent of those, they do not value the Welsh bac. But if they do offer an option with the Welsh bac, they say it is on top of three A2-level grades. So, obviously, we've had that track record. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the Welsh Government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses, but you look through the range, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects as well, across a number and range of universities,\u00a0the Welsh bac is always added as the additional one. So, bear in mind, then, that Welsh students are fighting for places against Scottish, Northern Irish and, potentially, English students who are studying three subjects, whereas our Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s, three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac. And, as we talked about earlier on, the Welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous, you could say complicated, qualification, which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they're trying to get possibly three A* grades. So, I think we need to consider that. In relation to the first answer, it is variable, and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicates about facilitating subjects, and Welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Si\u00e2n.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Maybe Dafydd can give us the picture from north Wales.", "Dafydd Evans: I mentioned before coming in, in terms of the context\u2014. Because of the nature of our catchment area, there is a greater percentage of our students staying in Welsh universities, and, as Kay said, Welsh universities are much more willing to recognise the bac. So, to a certain extent, it is less of a problem. But, naturally, we do have students who are looking to go out to universities in England in the Russell Group, and we're having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: But in terms of Bangor and Glynd\u0175r University, there's no problem there, though.", "Dafydd Evans: No, there is no problem there.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Right, the next questions are from Julie Morgan.", "Julie Morgan AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning. I think you've already got into this bit of the discussion, but what are your views on how comparable the Welsh bac is to other qualifications? I don't know if you've got any more comments on that.", "Dafydd Evans: Well, obviously, as we noted, it's become a very rigorous, very large qualification. Actually, it's probably larger than an A-level by now. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that's absolutely fine, but I think one of the problems that you're hearing is that perhaps the Welsh bac is trying to be all things to all men. At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up to a Russell university's expectations, and on the other hand, it's trying to develop softer skills and employment skills for people going into work from a vocational area. Can the same product deliver those two outcomes? I'm certainly not sure, and perhaps we need to think: what are we trying to achieve with this qualification?", "Julie Morgan AM: Right.", "Kay Martin: Yes, and earlier, we talked as well about that difference for the A-level students. They know what it is. It's worth UCAS points. For the vocational students, some things like the Career Ready programme, which is used in other colleges, and WorldSkills, you know, where all colleges have really been pushing to get more learners into WorldSkills at national and international level. And for some of our learners, particularly if we take our engineering learners, then having somebody who has competed in Europe as a tiler or an electrician would, I think, make an employer think, 'I'd better look at this person', whereas the other one\u00a0has done the Welsh bac\u2014.\u00a0I think they would look at the WorldSkills person first. And the investment we have to put into WorldSkills is huge. So, for some of our learners, we choose that you do WorldSkills, because that is going to be more valuable for you as a skill, and to show to an employer how much extra time you've put in. So, they put a lot of time\u2014you know, to get somebody into a WorldSkills competition is not just a couple of hours a week, it isn't just the normal curriculum\u2014they have extra time. They are more able and talented vocational learners, and that is more valuable to those learners and I think it's more valid for employers than the Welsh baccalaureate.", "Nick Brazil: I think it's got to, extending on what Kay says\u2014. It's got to be\u2014. You know, it is comparable, as long as it's right for that learner's future. If it's right for the learner's future, absolutely it's comparable. But if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the Welsh bac is not accepted, it's not comparable. But, then, if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector, absolutely. But it's got to be right for the learner.", "Julie Morgan AM: What are the reasons why some colleges do see it as being rigorous and others don't? Why does the view vary?", "Ed Evans: Can I give perhaps an employer's perspective on that, which might be completely wrong, but it's been interesting listening to what's been said here? About a year ago, we bought the\u00a0WJEC in to speak to our employers, or a number of them, just to explain to them what the Welsh bac was about\u2014back to listening and about understanding, really, and it just was not there at all. I could see that most of the employers\u00a0there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels. We've kind of gone into an university discussion here, but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. The skills that they bring having gone through this process I think most of the employers could get, at least in my sector, they could understand\u2014'I can see what that person can do.' But we've also seen it from university-educated people as well. They are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things. Those that bring a little bit of world experience, a little bit of the Welsh bac-type of things, just become far more rounded and useful people. I can understand why there's a certain obsession, almost, with the academic side of it, but I think we lose that vocational bit at our peril, and to a certain extent we probably haven't got it in many quarters anyway. So, for me, the Welsh bac helps to build that. Call it something else maybe, but that's what it should do.", "Julie Morgan AM: Right. And those skills that are learnt in the Welsh bac, can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications? Because I know that Cambridge university said to us they thought, in the four A-levels that they asked for, that those skills were there.", "Kay Martin: It probably depends on the subjects that\u00a0people are studying and the combination of subjects and the institution. Generally, in college, even if they're doing A-levels, they go out on some community projects or work-related education, without the Welsh bac\u2014even if they're not doing that. So, it does depend on the subject, I think.", "Dafydd Evans: I think there's a real danger of us perhaps becoming overly critical here as well of the Welsh bac\u00a0in terms of\u2014I don't think it's perfect by a long way, however, learners are getting some value out of that process. Certain learners in departments where they have really worked hard to contextualise the Welsh bac\u00a0within the vocational area, within the A-level subjects that the learners are doing, are finding it very rewarding. So, there are some very positive things coming out there. I think what we're suggesting is there may be even better ways of doing it and better ways of explaining to people what it's about.", "Nick Brazil: On this point about the skills being developed, I think that's debatable if all the skills that are supposed to be developed in the Welsh bac\u00a0are being developed, and that's why I think there's a need to relook at it to make sure those skills are being developed fully. But I will go back to the point that I think a comparable qualification is comparable as long as it achieves the right outcome for that particular learner. If you force a learner to do something that is not necessarily going to achieve the outcome that they require in their future, is it the right thing to be doing for that learner? That's what my concern is.", "Dr Rachel Bowen: I think the baccalaureate\u00a0approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look to teachers not as sources of information but just for guidance. That whole sort of approach about creating inquisitive young people with the skills that we've discussed, that's a real positive. The chances are that we've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification. The approach is a positive one.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you had a supplementary.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes, to both Rachel Bowen and Nick Brazil, if you don't mind. Both of you mentioned this is about skills and a piece of paper that demonstrates that you have these skills. At pre 16, would it be fair to say that there have been occasions when people have come presenting those pieces of paper but actually show none of the skills that they were supposed to have? The reason I'm asking this question, having had children who've gone through the process myself, is that in some schools, and I'm not saying all, doing the bac\u00a0is something that everybody does in the last four weeks of term, and that undermines the whole idea of the bac\u00a0anyway. It's just not fair on the learners or the people teaching the bac. Is that a fair observation?", "Dr Rachel Bowen: I think it's perfectly possible for learners to reach FE college having attained the Welsh bac\u00a0under the process that you've described, and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see.", "Nick Brazil: Yes, and at interview process or during an interview, or in the first week, you can see that they haven't developed those skills, and I think it is down to the variable models that have been put in place. There are lots of different models, and if you put, as I said, the model that you've described in place, there is no way, in that period of time, you're going to develop those skills. But that indicates, again, the value that people are putting on the qualification, if they are squeezing it into three or four weeks of term.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes. It might be different post 16\u2014I accept that. Okay. Thank you.", "Dr Rachel Bowen: And obviously practice will differ across schools.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Julie, did you have any more questions?", "Julie Morgan AM: No, I've finished, thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some questions now then, from Suzy, on universal adoption.", "Suzy Davies AM: Well, I'm wondering if I need to ask them, really, because I think I'm getting a strong sense that you all think that universal adoption is a bad idea at this moment in time. However, I do want to test something, because we have had witnesses who say that it would be a good idea because it reduces the amount of competition and advantage that certain institutions have. So, for example, we had an indication from the union representing Welsh-speaking teachers that if the baccalaureate was universally adopted, it would remove an artificial choice, basically, for learners,\u00a0i.e. they were losing Welsh-speaking students who didn't want to do the bac to English-speaking institutions. So, I wonder if you could tell me how much the decision in your individual colleges not to offer bac\u00a0is down to the opportunity that it presents you to attract students, particularly from sixth forms, where students may be obliged to do the bac.", "Kay Martin: That is not the case, I would say. When a learner comes to us, we\u2014. I'd like to think that all the staff in all the colleges do what is in the best interests of the learner. In some cases, it's to go back to school, and we absolutely say, 'You need to go back to school.' If somebody comes from a Welsh-medium school, then usually I will speak to the head and make sure that we have\u00a0a programme in place, that either they're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of Welsh, or that we make sure that they absolutely keep their Welsh language skills. We don't say, 'Come to us and you don't have to do the Welsh bac,' because if they do A-levels, we say it's compulsory, unless you're in the Seren group.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes. Well, that's the point; it's about English-speaking students, not just Welsh\u2014.", "Kay Martin: No, it isn't used. In the majority of colleges across Wales, it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool, because most of us, as you see, we value the Welsh bac. We'd like some changes to the Welsh bac, but we value the Welsh bac\u00a0in many cases. So, we wouldn't deliberately\u2014. I mean, if a course in my college doesn't want to do the Welsh bac, they have to come and give me evidence about why they don't think it's fit and what they're going to do in place of it. So, we don't deliberately tell people, 'Come\u00a0on in and you won't have to do it.'", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay, can I run that across you all, in an outburst of honesty?", "Dafydd Evans: Yes, absolutely. We universally adopt at level 3, but we don't at levels 1 and 2.", "Suzy Davies AM: Oh, yes, for the reasons you've given in the evidence, actually.", "Dafydd Evans: Yes, but across the whole of level 3, A-level and vocational, the Welsh bac\u00a0is an integral part of the curriculum, and it isn't an option for the student to opt out.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Do you let your Seren\u00a0students opt out like they do in Cardiff and the Vale, or do they have to do it as well?", "Dafydd Evans: We've forced\u2014. No, sorry, 'forced' is not the word. [Laughter.] We have encouraged and persuaded everybody to do it.", "Suzy Davies AM: So, that will be four A-levels plus bac.", "Dafydd Evans: Yes.", "Nick Brazil: I've got to be honest, at present, with our college, we do not ask. It's compulsory for A-level students to do the Welsh bac. It's an option of one of our choices\u2014we have a large choice\u2014and I think it comes back to that fact that we're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions. I think it's something we all need to consider across the nation, that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future. I will go back to the point I made earlier\u2014everything's comparable as long as it's the right thing for the learner's future, and I genuinely believe, and I'm sure a lot of colleagues believe, that that choice element is important to a learner, okay. If it is the right choice and if the Welsh bac\u00a0is the right choice, that is correct, and we move that along. Obviously, we debated about where there are elements that need to change. But you've got to be doing the right things for the learner, and we are certainly not selling it, 'Come\u00a0to us; you don't do the Welsh bac.' It is part of what we offer. It is part of what the college's curriculum offers\u2014there is no doubt about that\u2014and then people make a choice according to what they need to do to actually progress to what they need to do in their future.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you. I've just got one question for Mr Ed Evans, if that's okay. You explained earlier that if people knew what the bac was about in your sector, they'd value it more greatly, which I accept. Are you worried at all, though, that some of the more able and talented STEM students, in particular\u2014who are needed in your sector, after all\u2014might be deterred from doing those four A-levels because of the bac, because, presumably, you need a mix of these talents? You talked about the more able and talented vocational learners, but also you have more able and talented academic learners\u2014presumably you need them all.", "Ed Evans: We do. There's a big range, and some really high achievers coming into the sector as well. So, it is about that mix. I think the discussion that I've had with our employers has been around the academic side of things, if you like. The qualifications are well catered for. So, it's almost a given somebody's been through that route. What isn't there is some of those softer skills, but also some\u2014. I was almost going to call commercial skills 'soft' there\u2014.", "Suzy Davies AM: Call them 'commercial'.", "Ed Evans: Commercial skills are hard skills, which are very, very difficult to come by. So, the Welsh bac starts to do some of those things at different levels. Again, I'll come back to the input of businesses to support that delivery of commercial skills and so on, but I think I probably made that point earlier. So, I don't think it is a case of squeezing things out. There's clearly going to be different individuals who will cope better, and they will be, I guess, maybe guided as well by parents to a certain degree in terms of, 'You do those four and forget about that nonsense there', which is not helpful, but I can understand why that happens. So, for me, now, it's not a case of squeezing\u2014. This should be seen as an important part of creating a rounded individual ready for employment. I guess that's what a lot of our employers saw the Welsh bac\u00a0as being able to do. Whether that's a shared view is another matter.", "Suzy Davies AM: That's great. Thank you.", "Nick Brazil: Can I just add something to that? I think Ed's just said about the softer skills. Do the softer skills have to be developed through qualification? I think Kay mentioned a programme earlier on within her college. We run programmes as well. They're not qualifications, but they offer the opportunity to develop those softer skills. So, I think we're all in agreement about the development of the skills, but does it need to be through a qualification?", "Lynne Neagle AM: And you've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner. Are you aware, then, of any young people who are coming to you from the Swansea area because they've got that flexibility, which they may not have in one of the local schools?", "Nick Brazil: As I said, in terms of our offer, we offer a range in the curriculum. We're not going out there saying, 'Come\u00a0to us for this particular reason.'", "Lynne Neagle AM: No, but does anybody come to you and say, 'Well, actually, I've really come here because I don't have to do the Welsh bac'?", "Nick Brazil: The honest answer is it's one of the first questions that people always ask. But, as I've said, as a parent, I've been to open evenings and other open evenings. It's generally a question that people ask,\u00a0'Do\u00a0I have to do the Welsh bac?' It does come across not just in our open evenings, but in other open evenings that I've been to. It is always a question that people ask me. They do want to know that, and it's usually, as I said, one of the first questions that they ask.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And is that the parents asking the question or the pupil?", "Nick Brazil: It's a combination. But, honest answer, I would say parents, a lot of the time, but the learners usually\u2014as I said\u2014have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that's why they ask the question straight away.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Can I suggest that maybe, then, the perception that parents have is steering the way rather than the actual benefits for the pupil in your institution? If you're telling them, 'Come\u00a0to us, you don't have to actually do it because we know you don't like it', is that the correct way of approaching education?", "Nick Brazil: No. Education is about offering the range and offering it correctly.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: I'm being devil's advocate.", "Nick Brazil: Yes, I know, I totally understand, but it's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners. If you don't offer the full range, which, sometimes\u2014if you, obviously, limit and you make qualifications compulsory, that can limit the choice of opportunities as well. So, I think what parents and learners are looking for is for the range of options. There are some places in, I would think, some sixth forms now, where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra\u2014Welsh bac. So, for example, modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in Wales, and, I think, I picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is, 'We have to put our focus on the Welsh bac\u00a0to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language.'", "Sian Gwenllian AM: But it could be a short-sighted view because what some young people tell us is that at the time\u2014and parents\u2014they didn't really appreciate what skills they were actually learning, and by the time they'd got into employment, that working as a team, the communication skills, they thought, 'Ah, we\u00a0did\u2014. I know what this is about', and it all makes sense at that point. So, to try and, sort of, discourage it at a younger age may be doing them a disservice in the long run.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Well, we'll move on now then to\u2014.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: That's a question.", "Lynne Neagle AM: You do want an answer. Anybody want to pick that up?", "Dafydd Evans: We certainly have experience of that, of young people coming in with quite a negative attitude, originally, to the Welsh bac and taking it on board. But where we are delivering it well, well contextualised, they've really enjoyed the experience, and very much valued the experience. So, yes, there are certainly instances of that happening, there's no doubt.", "Ed Evans: We certainly see it, as employers. The penny drops after a few weeks or\u00a0months.", "Dafydd Evans: But don't underestimate the fact that\u00a0if you had a poor experience of the Welsh bac\u00a0at school, that perception is very difficult for us, as institutions, then, to change. Very difficult.", "Dr Rachel Bowen: It does make it into quite an intensive selling process for colleges when they've got to overcome that negative perception. As people have said already, it is possible to talk parents and learners round, but then that's time spent having to do that selling job when we should be talking about other things.", "Kay Martin: Can I just mention as well that there's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not A-levels? Perhaps you might want to do an engineering BTEC programme, or you might want to do a health and social care, or you might want to do hospitality. You might want to do BTEC\u00a0programmes, you can still go to university if that's what you want to do, or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards, and selling that whole range to parents, because there is an overemphasis, by us all, on A-levels\u2014.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that?", "Dafydd Evans: I'm not assured in terms of\u2014yes, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. When we were bringing lecturers from outside\u2014'Welsh bac\u00a0specialists' in inverted commas\u2014it was not working well. It has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum. Therefore, no, I think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and we've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac\u2014. It's been an intensive staff development process.", "Nick Brazil: And I think you've got to bear in mind that the number of the skills and the number of challenges that are done within the Welsh bac\u00a0are done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well. So, a number of those staff have already got those skills and they're undertaking that. I suppose when it comes to the word 'credibility' used in terms of the qualification, yes, I'm sure it would raise that focus on it, but ultimately, it's taking away from the fact that we have got staff who've got those skills and they're developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications they're doing. Something we were talking about earlier on is the fact is that, sometimes, that work is being repeated twice, because of the nature of the qualification.", "Dawn Bowden AM: And have you got dedicated time? Because one of the things we picked up from schools was that teachers in particular were kind of fitting it in with other lessons, and therefore, it wasn't being, again, given the same perceived level of importance as doing A-levels were. But your lecturers would all have dedicated time to deliver\u2014", "Kay Martin: On their timetables, yes. And as you say, industry specialists delivering some of those things put them more into context.", "Ed Evans: I was just going to add there, really, if you want to raise the profile amongst parents in particular, if you've got that\u00a0far clearer link between businesses coming in to deliver this\u2014. Apologies, I'd almost forgotten that we were in the Colegau thing, I was thinking 'schools' actually [Laughter.] But in terms of bringing those businesses into schools in a structured way, not an ad-hoc way, which is just a friend turning up to talk about something, a structured way\u2014. We have a programme under way at the moment called 'contextualising the curriculum' in the sector that we hope to roll out. Now, if that was rolled out across the board\u2014I'm not saying that it makes it easier for teachers in particular, but they are going to struggle to deliver some of these commercial and world-skilled, global areas, because it's not their bag. So, bring in\u00a0some experts, bring in some business, raise the profile, and I think then, possibly, you'll start to get parents thinking, 'Actually, there is something more to this than just the academic bit.'", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. I think all my other points have been answered, Chair. Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Can I just ask\u2014? You've all got slightly different policies; they don't have to do it in Swansea, in Cardiff and the Vale, they do unless they're in the Seren network, and in your college, everybody does it, even if they're doing four A-levels. Do you think that's a satisfactory situation, and are you satisfied with the communication and the guidance and the steer that everyone's getting from Welsh Government on this? Because we're meant to have a policy of universal adoption, but that doesn't really seem to be happening on the ground.", "Kay Martin: And I think, if you'd asked us a few years ago, we were all heading for universal adoption, but because the Welsh bac\u00a0has changed into something that isn't 100 per cent what we think it should be, then we've stopped the universal adoption, if you like. So, we are trying to do what's in the best interests of the learner, but I think, as you said, we've mentioned some other programmes, and if we could look at\u2014. We've got industry experts in colleges. We've got industry experts that are brought into colleges as well, some more than others, to bring that to life, if you like. We've got mentorship programmes, we send people out, and we just need to incorporate that better. We need to spend less time in checking what they've done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do, rather than it being too much of a paper exercise. By the time you've done all the paperwork you haven't got time to do any of the learning.", "Nick Brazil: I think, just to support Kay, we're going to need to go back to the original vision of the Welsh bac, which all of us would buy into 100 per cent. I think that has been lost as the qualification's developed over time, and, ultimately, I think all of us would like to see it go back to that to provide those skills that Ed has brought up and everything. I think we all support that. But is it quite right? I'm not sure at the moment.", "Dafydd Evans: I'll agree. We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the Welsh bac\u00a0is currently. Therefore, I think what we're saying is, if we're going universal adoption, it can't be with this product. This product isn't the product to universally adopt.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, that's interesting. Okay. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering our questions? It's been a very informative and interesting discussion. We will, as usual, send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your time this morning. Okay, item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, paper to note 2 is the letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales on home education, and paper to note 3 is the letter that the Cabinet Secretary for Education has sent to us in reply to our letter about free school meals. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then: can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting?

{"meeting_id": "m_test_14", "domain": "committee", "meeting_transcripts": ["Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received no apologies for absence. Suzy Davies is going to be arriving a little bit late. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No? Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is an evidence session to scrutinise the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Claire Bennett, who is deputy director for curriculum and assessment. Thank you all for attending this morning, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so if it's okay, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking you what the main messages are that you've received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Chair. If I may, I think it's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been. So, there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement, knowledge and opportunity as possible. So, working through the regional consortia, approximately 120 separate events were organised, and we believe that in the region of 6,000 headteachers, teachers, governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in those events. We also held a number of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves, so that they could give us their feedback. There were 24 focus groups that were arranged for children and young people. We also held some specific events to engage with the business community. We'll all be familiar, won't we, with the narrative of, 'Oh, we're sending people out into the world of business without the skills that we as an employer are looking for'. So we thought it was really important to engage business so that they can have their say and their input into the process. And obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their say. So, Members, I'm sure, will have been aware of the specific pages on Hwb that outlined the draft curriculum, and we had 275,000 unique visits to the Hwb curriculum pages. It's really interesting to see the breakdown of the areas of learning and experience\u2014which particular AoLEs were the most popular and were being looked at the most\u2014with our creative and performing arts and the creativity and the expressive arts being the most popular. So that's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular AoLE. What, then, have people said to us? Well, I'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing. There's real support for the need for change, because that's the first question, actually; why are we doing this, and why do we need to change? So, support for the need for change, and lots of support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum. So, good levels of support for the four purposes, and that driving the content below it. Strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession\u2014so, the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities. Also, a great welcome of the emphasis on formative assessment and the importance of formative assessment. In terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at, some of that is around some of the language used. Can we clarify, can we simplify in some areas, are there things that are repeated in a variety of AoLEs? Can we use that as an overarching, rather than repeating ourselves? Can we simplify it and clarify some of the language? Also, in some areas\u2014. It's interesting; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down, but in other areas, people say, 'Well actually, in this bit of it, we need a bit more detail, and a bit more depth and clarity'. So we'll be reflecting on all the feedback that we've had. That process has already started, but considering that this is a massive change, I have been hugely encouraged, actually, by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we're doing.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you, Minister. You said that you're reflecting on the messages that you've received. Are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance?", "Kirsty Williams AM: I think what's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession, we are doing it with our profession. So, in the spirit of co-construction, the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present.\u00a0So, Members will be aware that we've slightly changed the model. We had our pioneer school model and we have slightly refined that now. Pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward, and we've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools. But above and beyond the innovative schools, we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas, and they're the first part of that process. So, they met last week to begin looking at the feedback, and we'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine. Are there big changes to the concept? No. Opportunities to do things better, explain things better, simplify where possible, where we've been told that that needs to happen, provide greater depth where we've been told that needs to happen\u2014absolutely. We're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those, but in terms of the overall concept, then no, no significant changes.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. And what are the steps now before the final curriculum is published in January 2020?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, the quality\u2014. We call them\u2014it's not a very nice name\u2014quality improvement practitioners, the QI practitioners. So, these are the subject specialists. They met last week to begin this process. In October, there will be a number of workshops lasting three days at a time where those practitioners will continue that process of feedback with our curriculum and assessment group and all those people involved. By November, we would expect the QI groups to have completed their work and would want them to be in a position to hand over the refinements to an editorial process, and that has to be done in both languages. I think it's really important that we don't do it in English and then we simply translate it into Welsh. So, the editorial process will then be engaged to draw up the final example. It also, then, hands over to the publication team to do all the work on the publication, our website team will then be working on it, and then we would expect final publication in January\u2014am I right, Claire?", "Claire Bennett: Yes.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, January.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. We've got some specific questions now on the legislation from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: You've touched on the point that there's going to be some sort of change, and you've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation. We want to know what those aspects will be and what has made you change your mind.", "Kirsty Williams AM: The original proposal that we began working on was, in the legislation, to provide for the four purposes\u2014so, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation\u2014as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects\u2014so, the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency\u2014as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory, so, for instance, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports. A good example of that is relationships and sexuality education. I've already made an announcement that I was going to put RSE on the face of the Bill. So, the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the Bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody\u2014. So, we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters' statements. So, we're bringing it a step lower again. Rather than simply, in law, leaving it at the AoLE level, we'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters' statements within that, again, providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level. We'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas. So, there has been in the Chamber\u2014I can see Suzy is writing this down\u2014Suzy has asked me questions about, 'How do you create a national expectation around progression?' We've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process, so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out. As I said, we are proposing those changes because of responses that we've had. One of the consistent worries that some people have had, whilst being very supportive of the overall aims, is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school, but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern. So, we've reflected on that. I set up a process\u2014this was an open process, and we were open to listening to people. So, I think those will be the two main areas where we hadn't originally thought that we would legislate for, but that we will now legislate for.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. I haven't got the 'what matters'\u00a0statements in front of me\u2014", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, if you remember, we have the four purposes, and then we have the areas of learning and experience, and then, below the areas of learning and experience are the broad concepts that we would expect to be delivered in each of those areas of learning and experience. So, we're going to be refining some of those. Some of the feedback that we've had is that\u2014", "Sian Gwenllian AM: So, will you be adding to those?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Adding is not necessarily\u2014no, not adding. But, for instance, the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience. So, they'll be refined, but not added to, and then we will legislate for them, and that hadn't been the original intention.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Will they include mental health and well-being?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, the area of learning and experience for well-being is already there, and underneath that area of learning title, there are the broad concepts of what matters, what we believe matters, in that area of learning, and it is that that we will now actually put into the legislation. Sorry, I'm not helping, because I haven't got them with me either to read them out.", "Lynne Neagle AM: They are in the annex to the paper, Si\u00e2n, and, obviously, mental health is in there. So, just to clarify, then, that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, because the 'what matters' states very clearly the broad concepts in health and well-being. It refers to both physical and mental health, and we intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Claire, am I explaining it okay?", "Claire Bennett: Yes, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. These are the essence of the core content. So, the idea is to make sure that those are consistent, and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those, which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them. But the concept that you might not do one 'what matters'\u2014it was never what was intended. They were always intended to represent, as a whole, the learning that every learner should get. They won't be literally in the Bill, because, obviously, you might want to change the emphasis, so that'll be provided for in subordinate legislation, but the provision will be there, and they will have the status of something that's not optional, basically, for a school.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Therefore, it's not going to be on the face of the Bill\u2014the mental health aspect, for example. And there are other matters that we've raised here. This is what I'm not clear about. You're saying that it's subordinate, but then you're saying\u2014", "Kirsty Williams AM: So, on the face of the Bill, we will make provision to say that the 'what matters' statements have to be delivered. Over time, the 'what matters' statements might change. So the actual wording of the 'what matters' statements will be in secondary legislation; the need to deliver and the requirement, the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement, will be on the face of the Bill. So, for instance, education is changing all the time. If I think, if we had sat here 20 years ago, we probably, in a 'what matters' statement on health and well-being, wouldn't have referred to mental health, 20 years ago, because our understanding as a society, our willingness as a society to engage in that\u2014. So, if we had drawn up a 'what matters' statement even a decade ago, I suspect we wouldn't have talked about mental health. So, the concept of having to deliver the 'what matters' statement will be in the primary legislation; the actual wording, because otherwise if you wanted to change it you'd have to go through the entire process\u2014. So, the wording of the 'what matters' statement will be in secondary legislation. The actual need and the compulsion, the expectation that you have to do that, will be on the face of the Bill.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you had a supplementary.", "Suzy Davies AM: Just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation. The point you've made is one that Government has made with other legislation prior to this, but can I just ask you to consider the worthiness, if you like, or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters' statements, the first round of those, in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course? The reason I ask this is just to explain to the population of Wales that there is certainty at the first step, bearing in mind that it will change over the years\u2014I completely accept that. But when you're amending primary legislation, you don't have to go through the whole process again\u2014you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that. So, I'm just asking you to consider that.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, as I said, I think we've demonstrated that we're listening to people, that there has been concern expressed about certainty and having a national approach on some of these issues, and we have taken steps to address that and we'll continue to reflect, but, crucially, we'll continue to reflect with our partners who are co-constructing this with us. And I think the important thing to remember is that it's not Ministers or civil servants that are necessarily drawing up these 'what matters' statements, it is practitioners themselves, guided by experts in the field that are not teachers, that have come up with these things.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Obviously, the Bill will presumably come to this committee\u2014", "Kirsty Williams AM: We're assuming so.", "Lynne Neagle AM: And we'll have an opportunity to influence it. Si\u00e2n.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Moving on, therefore, to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education, I understand that you've had numerous responses to the White Paper surrounding this particular area. What are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what's been said?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, these two areas certainly have ensured that lots of people have responded. It's interesting that people are far more interested in what we may or may not do about these two subjects than maths, English, Welsh, science, but there we go; I guess it's the nature of the areas that we're talking about. With regard to religious education, we had a significant number of people that have expressed concerns about our approaches towards RE that were set out in the White Paper. I think amongst the things that people have objected to were\u2014. There were very mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions included in that area of learning. Many people said that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger\u2014and in some cases exclusive\u2014focus on Christianity, as opposed to including other world religions and, indeed, non-religious views. So, secular views or spiritual\u2014spirituality rather than organised religion. There were people who thought that RE shouldn't be compulsory at all and therefore our proposals to ensure that RE was compulsory, people objected to that, on the other\u2014. And there were many responses that were concerned about and emphasised the need to respect parents' views. So, if a child's parents have certain views, those are to be respected. Of those respondents that agreed that RE should be a compulsory part of the curriculum, or were neutral\u2014didn't express an opinion either way, but were neutral on the question\u2014the issues that they were bringing forward were: a need for learners, as they saw it, to be prepared to be part of a diverse and multicultural society. So, they wanted RE to be much more broad-based and encompassing of world views and world religions. They felt that that was an important part of preparing a young person to live in a world that is, as you say, diverse with people of different views living in it. There is certainly a need to modernise RE; some people perceived the current curriculum as a bit old-fashioned. And also there was much feedback on making sure that the profession was ready to deliver a renewed, modernised RE curriculum. So, those are the issues around religious education\u2014", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Can I just\u2014? Before you go on to the next section\u2014is there evidence that this was a co-ordinated lobby to present a particular view and what is your response going to be to this? Obviously, there are always going to be lobbies presenting particular viewpoints. Our role, as politicians, is to lead, obviously, isn't it?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. Claire, would you say that it was a co-ordinated response?", "Claire Bennett: It wasn't a campaign in the sense of it being completely consistent, but, certainly, I think people with a particular interest in this issues felt galvanised to respond to the White Paper on this issue\u2014on this one and on relationships and sex education.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And your response?", "Kirsty Williams AM: And my response: well, clearly, Si\u00e2n, I need to consider those responses, and both for RE and RSE, I shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues. With regard to RSE, the key messages, again, are focused on whether children should be taught RSE at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it shouldn't be a compulsory part of the curriculum\u2014that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education. There were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum. So, those were the main areas that people were concerned about. With regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum, there were strong views that, again, it should be parents, and parents alone, that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules. So, I have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise. I think these are really important aspects of our curriculum. I think if we are to achieve the four purposes, and that's how we have always got to think about it, and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system\u2014how do we achieve those purposes? How are they healthy, confident individuals? How are we to prepare our children to be ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world? So, we will reflect on what has come back to us, but I do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum, if we are to achieve the four purposes.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you. You've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. What is the timetable for the Bill itself and for seeking Royal Assent for that?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay, so, as I said earlier, the expectation is that we will publish a final version of the curriculum in January 2020, so schools will then have the opportunity to be really engaging in it. I have to say, I'm in schools most weeks, and many, many, many schools are already taking the opportunity, even on the draft, to begin to think about planning and, indeed, changing what they're doing in schools. I'm overwhelmed, actually, by the enthusiasm of the sector to embrace what is a massive change for them. So, that's January. We would expect to introduce the Bill following the Easter recess.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. That gives enough time, then, for it to be\u2014", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: \u2014actually implemented in September\u2014", "Kirsty Williams AM: In 2022.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: In 2022, yes.", "Kirsty Williams AM: And I think what's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in January itself, because that's the bit that schools are really concerned about, and then we will have the process here to underpin it.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David.", "Hefin David AM: Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton?", "Kirsty Williams AM: I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap.", "Hefin David AM: Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools.", "Hefin David AM: What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical.", "Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them.", "Hefin David AM: So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes.", "Hefin David AM: Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.'", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems.", "Hefin David AM: It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment.", "Kirsty Williams AM: I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation.", "Hefin David AM: Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014", "Hefin David AM: Bridges have been built.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on.", "Hefin David AM: I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv.", "Kirsty Williams AM: And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know.", "Hefin David AM: And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot.", "Steve Davies: As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform.", "Kirsty Williams AM: The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay.", "Hefin David AM: When did that take place?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Where?", "Hefin David AM: When.", "Kirsty Williams AM: The weekend just gone.", "Hefin David AM: Right.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014", "Suzy Davies AM: This isn't about assessment.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Oh, okay. Go on, then.", "Suzy Davies AM: So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014", "Suzy Davies AM: Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this.", "Steve Davies: In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014?", "Claire Bennett: I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years.", "Kirsty Williams AM: And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward.", "Suzy Davies AM: Can I just have a quick\u2014?", "Lynne Neagle AM: Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough?", "Kirsty Williams AM: I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. I'll keep my questions shorter.", "Lynne Neagle AM: The next questions are from Dawn Bowden.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Yes, just around preparations for the implementation, really. You touched on this briefly in response to some questions from Hefin David earlier on, but I'm just interested to know how the money that you announced for supporting teachers for the preparation of the implementation, how that's actually been used. What specifically have teachers been doing to prepare for its implementation? I know you've set aside about \u00a324 million over two years. So, it's not an insignificant amount. I just wondered how that was being utilised.", "Kirsty Williams AM: You're right, first of all, it's not an insignificant amount; it's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. So, you're right that it is not insignificant, and it was a hard-won resource, I can tell you, from my colleagues. Because, as I said earlier, the curriculum itself can be amazing, but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it, then all this change will be for nothing. So, investing in the profession is absolutely crucial. That money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we've just heard from Claire, there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain. There are other schools that maybe are only beginning now, now that it's published, to be really engaging with the curriculum.", "Dawn Bowden AM: So, there hasn't been a national programme, as such.", "Kirsty Williams AM: There is a national element to it, but we've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because I have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they're going to need. There's no way I can know that. The people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools. But we have worked with the National Academy for Educational Leadership to put together a programme for headteachers, and that's national. The four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement. So, actually, the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum. The next stages will be much more focused on individual AoLE and area-specific professional learning. So, there is a national approach in terms of leadership. The regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants, and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics. Claire referred to the AoLE networks, and there's an opportunity then for people to engage in that. It's also important to say that that's not the end of the process. So, this September is the start of our new ITE courses, taught for the first time, and that's great. I'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ITE. So, we're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support, again on a national basis, for those who are newly qualified, beginning their teaching career, because I don't think we've done that on a consistently good level across the country. We're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system. We're also involved in\u2014and I'm sure the committee has heard about it, so forgive me if I'm going over old ground\u2014schools as learning organisations and the OECD work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation. We know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong, strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system, and we've not been very good at that in Wales, we've not been strong at that, that's not the culture that we have had. We've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you're good or bad, rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about, 'What are we doing well and what do we need to improve on?' So, the schools as learning organisations are an important part, again, so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the OECD.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. And the money that you announced for this\u00a0\u00a0professional development preparation, if you like, was for two years. So, there's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development, as well as anything else. But is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues? Or do you see what you've put in as being, 'This is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation. The rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that'?", "Kirsty Williams AM: The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and, clearly, I continue to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning, and I'm sure this committee and, indeed, members of this committee could help me in that task.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay, fine. Can you tell us a bit about the innovation schools\u2014the 16 innovation schools\u2014and how you've made your decisions about who they might be, across which sectors, in primary, secondary and so on? So, basically, how they were selected and what you're expecting of them.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase, which is innovation schools, and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within Welsh Government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us, going forward. I think one of the lessons learned, and this was said in the committee, was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools, but there was a downside to having pioneer schools, and I think, at this stage of the game, we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now\u2014everybody had to be a pioneer\u2014because this is coming down the track and we don't want anybody just sitting there waiting until September 2022 and saying, 'Oh, gosh. I've got to do something new today'. Not that they would have done that, but\u2014. So, the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we've all got to engage in this now. The innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement, and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues. Steve.", "Steve Davies: Yes. There were 60 applicants from 170 previous pioneer schools. We've had 16\u2014four per region. It was important that we engaged with the regions to get their view, and we've had evaluation being carried out\u2014", "Claire Bennett: Yes. So, during the first term of work, we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole\u2014so, take the whole curriculum guidance and then think, 'How would I apply that in the school?, Does it make sense?, Can we work with it?, What are the issues?, What are the questions that arise for us for assessment?', and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on, 'If I were putting this into practice\u2014'. So, it's slightly different to the feedback we've had from other people, which has been more, 'Maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording' and kind of quite practical, and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school. That's been drawn together into an overall report, drawing out the themes, by Wavehill, who are a kind of research company. It's been really useful, and the innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week. Having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable, in just making us think, even with all the practitioners that have been involved, 'How do we make this work for schools?', given that we've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically. So, it's been invaluable, and they're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically.", "Kirsty Williams AM: If you think of the pioneer model, pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. So, you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being, or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum. This is about, at this stage, where we have a high degree of certainty about what it's going to look like, 'Actually, how do I as a school practically implement this in the round?', and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that. But also we did need a mix of sector\u2014secondary, primary\u2014but also linguistically, to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we've got. Faith schools, as well, are involved. So, just trying the practical implementation now, now that we know exactly\u2014not exactly\u2014 but we have a good idea what it's actually going to look like, so, 'How am I going to go about doing this?'", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Si\u00e2n has a supplementary. If I could ask as well, maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, sure. No problem at all.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Are you confident that every school across Wales is participating in this process of change now, because the danger is, in getting these pioneer schools\u2014? I understand that they are discussing in clusters, and so on, but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now?", "Steve Davies: I can't tell you that, absolutely, 100 per cent are definitely, totally, absolutely equally involved. The structure we've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually\u2014not readiness to engage\u2014start to deliver as we move through to the future. So, each region is a member of our operations board, which was in our governance structure. And we don't have a roll-call against all schools, but we require them, or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks. Every school is part of a network that links to it, and they gauge (1) the level of activity in it, (2) the outcomes of that work, because each of the networks, each of the clusters, produces work that the region brings together. But we've not got a monitoring system that says, 'Tick every box'. What I would say, and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to Scotland, I think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this, it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver. At a regional level, we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Dawn.", "Dawn Bowden AM: I just wanted to clarify, because in your paper you talk about giving \u00a330,000 to each, or to the innovation schools. Was that \u00a330,000 each, or \u00a330,000 for the project?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Each school that participates in the innovation schools programme gets \u00a330,000.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you for that clarification. My final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in Wales. So, teachers trained in England apply for jobs in Wales, but they obviously haven't been trained in the new curriculum. How are we actually going to deal with that?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, you're right\u2014we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in Wales will teach in England and teachers trained in England or who have worked in England will come across the border, as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools. I think that that will continue to happen. Indeed, when I'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues, I think Wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals, as well as an exciting new curriculum. So, I think, actually, potentially, we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it'll be a great place to be a professional. Clearly, already in some ways, programmes of study are already distinctive in Wales. We have a different exam board, if you're teaching at a secondary level. So, our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system. I believe that that's not a barrier to people continuing to do that. Clearly, there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with, but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system, because we've just talked about the two years' worth of money; in an ideal world, if I was able to make long-term plans, I think there will be an ongoing, and there should always be an ongoing, provision for professional learning in our classrooms. And this shouldn't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets. One of the ways in which I think we can attract teachers to Wales is to send a very clear message\u2014 and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession, wherever they train\u2014that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning. So, I do not see that this is an insurmountable issue.", "Dawn Bowden AM: So, you'll still be recruiting on the basis of skills and adaptability and so on.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, of course.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chair.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We've got a lot of issues to cover, so I'm going to appeal for concise questions, concise answers. On to assessment, progression and accountability\u2014Suzy.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. We've set the scene. What was the feedback like with regard to the draft assessment proposals?", "Lynne Neagle AM: Excellent, concise question. [Laughter.]", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, the principles were broadly supported, Suzy. We received what I would describe as positive feedback regarding the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment that is there to support children's learning and progression. Key messages were perhaps to find a better way of expressing the purposes of assessment\u2014we refer to a formative and summative assessment\u2014and just being a bit clearer about what that actually means and being clear about definitions around it. But, generally, supported.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. That's a good concise answer as well.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Yes, well done.", "Suzy Davies AM: Obviously, we're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well. Presumably, the way you're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate, and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be\u2014. They're out in a separate document; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document\u2014is that right? There's a thick black line between these two concepts.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, absolutely. I think some of the trouble that we've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability, and, when you start using assessment for accountability purposes, that's when, potentially, that assessment process gets corrupted and you have gaming.", "Suzy Davies AM: Can I ask, with the assessments, though, which is about pupil progression, will those results be published internally? Will parents get to see those?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Oh, yes. And that should be the purpose for assessment. The primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents, whether they're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment. So, absolutely, you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods, whichever type they use, with parents, to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child.", "Suzy Davies AM: Right. I accept that. Is it realistic, then, to expect parents, families, communities, not to think about that information when they're drawing conclusions about the school, notwithstanding that formal evaluation of those schools is going to be done completely separately?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, of course, parents will always be interested in how the overall institution is doing. But the conversations I have with parents, and I certainly feel this myself as a parent\u2014I'm interested in how my child is doing, how my child is getting on in school, what are the issues that that child has, and, more importantly, what is the school going to do about it? So, if my child is struggling for whatever reason, what is the school going to do about that to help that child? If my child happens to be exceptionally able and talented, how are you as a school going to make the most of my child's talents and move them on to fulfil their potential? So, undoubtedly, I can't control assumptions that parents will make, but it is absolutely clear in this system, and my intention is, that teachers should share assessment methods and outcomes with parents to have that conversation about what happens next. But I am absolutely clear that we do have to make this distinction between assessment for learning and an accountability in the system, otherwise we drive\u2014inadvertently; people don't set out to do it, but we drive a set of behaviours that has negative unintended outcomes. We only have to look at the debacle around BTEC science to know that.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. I understand that. So, how\u2014? Can you just briefly give us an indication of how you think the accountability, on both sides of that thick black line\u2014the methodology\u2014is likely to change with this? You mentioned that there's going to be an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly; we know that some of the existing ones have been ditched in fairly recent legislation. Without pre-empting the findings of such a review, have you got your top three likely expected changes?", "Kirsty Williams AM: To accountability?", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes.", "Kirsty Williams AM: To accountability. Well, we're moving to a system of schools as learning organisations, and a greater emphasis on self-evaluation, with external verification of that by Estyn, our inspectors.", "Suzy Davies AM: And that will be reflected in the school categorisation system as well\u2014will those indicators change, do you think?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, categorisation\u2014again, the purpose for categorisation is not to make a judgment on a school in the sense of a league table; it's a triage process, categorisation.", "Suzy Davies AM: It's how it seen, though, sometimes.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, this is the issue, isn't it? This is the problem of designing a system where there are perfectly good reasons to introduce the system\u2014and in this case it's a triage system to identify levels of support for a school. But then others come along and turn it into something else that it was never intended to be. And categorisation was never intended to be a way of expressing a league table of school performances; it's there to identify levels of support that a school can expect from its regional consortia. Now, we have, we have\u2014we will continue to keep categorisation, but, since coming into office, we have tried to adapt categorisation simply away from pure data to a more formative assessment process, and categorisation will continue to evolve. The message is very clear: this is not to absolve our system of accountability. And the first level of accountability in that system has to be the professionalism of an individual member of staff\u2014the moral purpose that I bring to my classroom today to do right by the children that are in front of me. That's the first level of our accountability, and therefore we have our new teaching standards. As a leader, we have new leadership standards. That's the first part of our accountability regime\u2014the moral purpose our professionals bring to their work. So, categorisation will stay. Will it evolve? Yes, because it's been evolving over the last three years. This is about better accountability, smarter accountability, not less accountability.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, just finally on that, there may be an argument, then, for scrapping categorisation, putting something else in place. But I suppose the core question is: how are the general public going to understand all those things that you've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach, the leaders being able to lead, and how well a school is performing against KPIs on those measures?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, because we will still\u2014. We will still have inspections, won't we?", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. So, it's all going to go in through the Estyn reports. This is the kind of detail I'm after.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, that's the ultimate, isn't it? So, the ultimate is\u2014. The ultimate system that we're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in Estyn. But it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff. That's where it starts, and it ends in Estyn.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Will you just let me have this one?", "Lynne Neagle AM: Go on, then.", "Suzy Davies AM: I don't think I've quite followed that journey. Because I get the point of the end point being Estyn, and that's where the public assurance will be seen, but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards? Where will we see those demonstrated?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, you would expect to see those demonstrated in the self-evaluation that a school will provide of itself, and then Estyn\u2014", "Suzy Davies AM: All right, so schools will be publishing self-evaluations annually, or something like that?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, schools\u2014", "Steve Davies: The outcome of the self-evaluation is a school development plan. We expect those to be considerably enhanced.", "Kirsty Williams AM: And available.", "Steve Davies: We expect a series of priorities for a school to set itself as a result of prioritisation. We expect that to be published through the school website, so the outcomes of that. What we're looking at, in terms of what's brought to that, is not a narrow set of measures\u2014just two measures, or one measure in a secondary school. The measures will still consider reflection on progress of children, but it'll also have reviews of mental health, well-being, how it approaches that and things that it wanted to do. It's broadening the evidence base. The school is evaluating\u2014the outcome of that will be a development plan, annually published on the website. Within the plan, they will have a set area of priorities that they will be publishing.", "Kirsty Williams AM: And the schools' ability\u2014whether they do that well or whether they don't do it well\u2014will be judged by Estyn.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you. That's really helpful.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, as my colleague Chair Dai Lloyd would say, 'Now we're into the needing serious agility territory'. So, we've got some questions on specific areas. Firstly from me: Qualifications Wales have told us that the curriculum must define qualifications rather than the other way around. What implications does that have for the amount of time that is needed to develop qualifications that are properly aligned with the new curriculum?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I'd absolutely agree with Qualifications Wales. The qualifications have to arise out of the curriculum, and the qualifications should not be dictating the curriculum. Qualifications Wales, which I met with yesterday, I think\u2014yes, yesterday; it seems a long time ago\u2014will begin their national conversation about reform of qualifications as a result of curriculum reform in November.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Janet.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. How is awareness and understanding of human rights, including children\u2019s rights, being embedded in the new curriculum?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Children's rights, human rights\u2014they've been key considerations throughout the design, and this is currently set out in overarching guidance and we continue to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And I'm delighted that the children's commissioner took the time to write to me during the feedback phase to say that they were very pleased that their initial assessment demonstrates that what we're proposing is a big step forward.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. And how do you respond to the concerns expressed in the children's commissioner\u2019s quarterly report of July 2019 that consultation materials for young people were not released until mid June, allowing just over a month for young people to engage? And they said it was disappointing that a plan was not in place at the start of the consultation period.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people, as I said at the beginning. We had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and we had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning. It's a powerful contribution and I think will actually effect change, especially in how the 'what matters' statements are worded.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Si\u00e2n.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Turning to the Welsh dimension in the new curriculum, the Learned Society of Wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource?", "Kirsty Williams AM: We have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum. It's one of the conversations I had with Qualifications Wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we've had previously, where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications aren't available. So, we're already having those conversations with Qualifications Wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum. And this proposal by the Learned Society will be considered as part of that work.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And, in terms of the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language, how are progression steps and achievement outcomes in Welsh-medium schools going to work and how are they going to work in English-medium schools?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Just on the Welsh dimension, I think it's really important that whatever resources we have to support the Welsh dimension are really, really, really broad and not confined to specific areas. I was in Swansea University just this week, looking at some of their Technocamp work that they're doing to help us with coding, and we had an amazing conversation about the Welsh contribution to the computing industry. And so my expectation is that that isn't taught in a history lesson\u2014that, actually, when children are learning about coding, they get to hear that Welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology. So, that's\u2014. When I talk about a Welsh dimension, I mean right the way across the curriculum, and I think that's important. With regard to\u2014. The continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught. We have to recognise\u2014. We have to recognise that, and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language, and they have to be contextualised. We recognise that children learning Welsh in a Welsh-medium school, their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker, and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning Welsh in an English-medium school. Vice versa\u2014we've had this discussion before\u2014if a child is going into Welsh medium, their progression in English perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an English-medium school, although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position. So, we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school, but recognising that it is a progression. It isn't a start and never get any further.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: With regard to the creative thinking element of PISA, I take it that you are adhering to the fact that the Welsh Government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to PISA 2020. I don't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking. So, why not participate in these tests?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Because, for me, the key factor for making that decision, and I intend to stick to it, is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum\u2014", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay, so it's the timing.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, for me.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: So, later on, maybe when this is embedded\u2014", "Kirsty Williams AM: I think there could well be a different decision at a later date, but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it. Can I just say? In terms of creativity, Wales is seen as an exemplar by the OECD, especially our partnership with the Arts Council of Wales and creative learning through the arts.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: I get that. That's why I don't understand why we're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the PISA. But, I understand.", "Kirsty Williams AM: There could well be a different decision, but for 2021 we're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with. I just don't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system. The very opposite is true. We are seen as exemplars by the OECD\u00a0and some of the work that's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: So, you'll think about it for the next round of PISA.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Oh gosh, that shows that Si\u00e2n thinks that I'll be here to make that decision. [Laughter.] That's very encouraging indeed. [Laughter.]", "Steve Davies: One very quick technical point, Chair. We have not opted out of this. Countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it, and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Janet, you've got a question on physical activity.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Can you give a guarantee that all children and young people, where appropriate, will take part in physical activity under the new curriculum for Wales? Also, how much time per week will the Government expect children and young people to spend undertaking physical activity?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, all children will be given that opportunity, because if they are not then that school would be in breach of the expectations that will be set out in statute.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: How will you monitor it?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Again, Janet, I don't go around monitoring schools now.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: No, but through the systems and mechanisms in place.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, of course. As we've just said\u2014", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: How will you ensure that every child has that opportunity?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, as we've just said, ultimately, we are not getting rid of our school improvement services and regional consortia, nor are we getting rid of Estyn. So, one would expect the quality of the curriculum to be a key consideration of any visit that Estyn would make to a school.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy, you've got a question on early years.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes. To what extent will the new curriculum allow for the continuity of the way that the foundation phase is taught? Will there be any significant differences and have the early years professionals been involved in the development of the curriculum to date?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, early years professionals have been involved in the curriculum to date. One of the advantages, I think, of the new curriculum is to take the pedagogical principles that underpin our approach to early years education actually further into children's educational journey. I'm sure, Suzy, that you've had conversations that\u2014. We have a certain pedagogical approach until the age of seven, and then all of a sudden, at seven, it's like, 'Forget all of that now. Sit down, pick up your pen and do this.' That's been really uncomfortable for many practitioners in our primary sector. So, actually, yes, statutory and non-statutory provision have been involved in the development of the curriculum because, of course, some of this is going to be delivered in the non-statutory sector. I'm very welcoming and supportive of that, but those pedagogical principles will now be available throughout that child's educational journey, rather than the false divide we've got at the moment.", "Suzy Davies AM: So, aside from the purposes and the AoLEs, the type of teaching is unlikely to change in the foundation phase settings.", "Kirsty Williams AM: No.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. The other end of the scale now: you report that one of the themes of the feedback from further education has been the need to ensure that the transition to post-16 education is supported so that the systems don't just clash against each other. How are you working on the sector at the moment to make sure that there's a decent dovetail?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, that's really important. We don't want to do anything in pre-16 that stops people going on to be successful in post-16, whichever route the child or young person decides to take. FE have been involved in every single AoLE and they're a part of the curriculum and assessment group. So, colleagues in FE have been part of this process throughout. And then in the conversations we had yesterday with Qualifications Wales around what qualifications will look like, I was very keen to take the opportunity to emphasise that any changes to qualifications should be a gateway to further study in FE, whichever type of route the child took. But FE have been involved in this process from the very beginning.", "Suzy Davies AM: And you're confident they're geared up to accepting young people who have been educated in this way.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, absolutely. FE continues to be one of the real strengths of our education system.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay, that's great, thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got a question now on governance arrangements. Suzy, you're down to do that one\u2014sorry, Si\u00e2n.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: I think you actually answered this at the beginning, but just to confirm that you're carrying on with the same governance set-up, the different groups that you've got, and there's nothing being added there or taken away.", "Kirsty Williams AM: No.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And just finally from me, then, on pupil referral units: what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, we've been taking advice from Brett Pugh, who chairs the education otherwise than at school improvement group, and this has been an area where we've had to think really, really, really, really, really hard. So, what we intend to do for EOTAS and PRU is to set a minimum of what we would expect a child to receive. So, that would be around the four purposes; that would be around the cross-cutting themes of literacy, numeracy and digital competency and health and well-being. So, that would be the baseline of our expectation, that every pupil would get that. After that, then there needs to be a discussion and a focus on what is in the best interests of that particular pupil. One of the things we know about sometimes in EOTAS is we have very able and talented students who don't get access to the range of qualifications and courses that they have the capability and the aptitude to do. We also have to consider, though, that for some children they may be out of school for reasons, and telling them that they've got to do a full curriculum may be hugely detrimental to their mental health and well-being. So, for instance, to give an example, you could have a child who's very ill, and saying to them, 'You have to carry the full load of a curriculum' could be inappropriate. So, we'll be setting a minimum standard, as I said, around the purposes, around the cross-cutting themes and health and well-being, and then there will be an expectation that in conjunction with the child and the family an appropriate addition would be put in place to meet the needs of that child, recognising that they could have very different needs. Is that clear?", "Lynne Neagle AM: Well, yes, and it's something that we'll probably look to build on when we look at our inquiry on EOTAS, which is coming up. Thank you. That concludes our questions. We've covered a lot of ground. So, can I thank you for attending and thank your officials for coming today? As usual, we will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for your attendance this morning.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Item 3 then is papers to note. As Members will see, there are a substantial number of papers to note\u201423 in total, which are in a supplementary pack. As there are so many, can I suggest that we note them all together and then we've got an opportunity to return to some of them in the private session afterwards? Is that okay with everybody? Okay. Thank you. Item 4 then. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting?

Don't know .", "Professor D: So uh  so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , uh , then they can run off . It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , but um , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . So , I th I think  I think we should start doing that . Um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can , uh  I don't know .

Is it", "PhD F: Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up .", "Professor D: Yeah .", "PhD F: Um , at the previous  at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping  about wanting to get more data and I  I talked about this with Jane and Adam , um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new  this new student di does wanna work with us ,", "PhD A: Well , great .", "PhD F: th the guy that was at the last meeting .", "PhD A: Great .", "PhD F: And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time ,", "PhD A: What a deal .", "PhD F: uh  Yeah .", "Grad B: And what 's he interested in , specifically ?", "PhD F: So he 's  comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody ,", "Grad B: Mm - hmm . Great .", "PhD F: so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts  he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with .", "Grad B: Right .", "PhD F: But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one  one - time", "Grad B: One offs ?", "PhD F: Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the , um  to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about . I mean it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . So . Then I was um , talking to Morgan about some  new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to  listen to . And in that uh , regard , I thought we definitely w will need  it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this  this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I  You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "PhD F: Um , and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting  and maybe a networking  group meeting .", "Grad B: Right . Yep . Yeah , we 're  we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly .", "PhD F: So  So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough .", "Grad B: So . Mm - hmm .", "PhD F: But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting    meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize ,", "Grad B: Yeah .", "PhD F: but  rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries .

But maybe that 's enough . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar ,", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "PhD F: like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same .", "Grad B: Um", "Professor D: Now , let  l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I  I don't disagree with that , but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . Uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , I actually feel the opposite need . I 'd like to have lots of different people .", "PhD F: Right . Right .", "Professor D: As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view .

I think this fits uh at the  uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good .

You think you can't make a TV controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: But uh well , I think that's a good example .", "Project Manager: Okay ,", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it .", "User Interface: Okay , sorry .", "Project Manager: Is it fin Are you finished ?", "User Interface: Well uh", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um  Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh  Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh  And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the TV . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things", "Project Manager: So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?", "Industrial Designer: but  Yeah . I I think so .", "User Interface: Uh j Is", "Industrial Designer: I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .", "Project Manager: Yeah , it's  I think it's usable .", "User Interface: Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?", "Marketing: Yeah , that's active .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Or just a green one ,", "User Interface: So", "Project Manager: because it's  If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .", "User Interface: Yeah . Maybe uh", "Marketing: I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , when you press it .", "Project Manager: But if you", "Industrial Designer: So", "Marketing: I it's it's just uh the the", "Project Manager: Red's l shows up like something's wrong ,", "Industrial Designer: Two ?", "Project Manager: and green is like it's okay , you press the button .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno .", "User Interface: Maybe depends on uh", "Industrial Designer: Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I know .", "User Interface: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay , we make it red .", "User Interface: But maybe", "Industrial Designer: So", "User Interface: Well", "Industrial Designer: I know .", "User Interface: we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well .", "Project Manager: You have to  The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . Uh that's cool .", "Industrial Designer: I I think uh the batteries will be uh  a little", "User Interface: Uh   Oh ,", "Marketing: Empty .", "User Interface: maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh", "Project Manager: No , we have a recharger in it , so", "User Interface: Oh .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: If we can still make that then", "Industrial Designer: Uh maybe .", "User Interface: Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red .", "User Interface: It's just to indicate something's on .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low .", "Project Manager: But it's cool if it was green .", "User Interface: Yeah . It's it's not very important ,", "Project Manager: Green or red or whatever , it is cool .", "User Interface: so yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working .", "User Interface: So mm", "Industrial Designer: And uh the receptor in the TV senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the TVs . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the  Otherwise it won't work .", "User Interface: So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh", "Industrial Designer: No .

Yeah , or  I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there .", "User Interface: Well , I I use a universal uh remote control ,", "Marketing: Uh I kno", "User Interface: and  list of all the TVs you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , so it works on your TV .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay .", "Marketing: Oh , I have a modern one .", "Marketing: And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it ,", "Industrial Designer: Ah okay .", "Marketing: and then it's okay . So you don't have to search for your television or your code .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: It uh search uh the pattern for itself .", "User Interface: Okay ,", "Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah .", "User Interface: so we use that .", "Industrial Designer: So it uh  We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to", "Marketing: Yes .", "User Interface: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: I just say  Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking  There's just a short", "Industrial Designer: Uh okay . Well uh y you have this chip .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: But uh ma basically for uh brands of TV these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one TV it go go to one . And on the other TV it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .", "Marketing: Changing the signal .", "Industrial Designer: And um  What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so  And then he saves that setting", "Project Manager: Okay . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and then um it's working .", "Marketing: Yeah , that's the right uh option .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Well uh the components .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't  I w I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Um that's connecting to all the components .", "Industrial Designer: Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .", "Project Manager: Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too .", "Industrial Designer: But this one is producing infrared light", "Project Manager: Yeah , okay .", "Industrial Designer: that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light .", "Project Manager: So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one .

But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can  Basically if the battery is low , it won't work .", "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah , and", "Project Manager: Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button .", "Industrial Designer: Huh , that's a good idea .", "Marketing: Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal .", "User Interface: No , y Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: And it's  you also know which button you p", "Marketing: But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right .

There . Yeah .", "Marketing: Maybe uh", "Project Manager: The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ?", "User Interface: Yeah , we're thinking about it .", "Project Manager: If you push", "User Interface: Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh", "Project Manager: It lights up .

Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .", "Marketing: Bec Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "User Interface: I think uh you also have uh  remote controls with a lot of options .", "Marketing: So", "User Interface: But we lose about ninety percent of those options .

Only in English I think .", "User Interface: What  But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh  Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but", "User Interface: uh one to have in channel one ?", "Marketing: No , that  Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do  do we do it ?", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Marketing: It's more if we if we do it .", "User Interface: I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at .", "Industrial Designer: And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: or", "Project Manager: Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that .", "User Interface: Is", "Project Manager: It  We have short time to to put it on the market ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno .", "Project Manager: so that  We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .", "User Interface: Mm  Yeah well", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think so .", "Project Manager: We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy .", "Marketing: Yeah , and uh and uh", "User Interface: It's", "Marketing: In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing .

Yeah yeah ,", "User Interface: Yeah , but um", "Marketing: it it mustn't work all the time .", "User Interface: Yes , that's what I mean .", "Marketing: It uh uh it have to work only when you use it .", "Project Manager: Or you can switch it on or something .", "Marketing: So if you", "User Interface: Or maybe when you", "Marketing: No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .", "User Interface: yeah . It lights up all .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right . You have to  Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .", "User Interface: Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah .", "Project Manager: And do we use a a  Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac ,  if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control .", "User Interface: Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod .", "Industrial Designer: Mm , maybe it's a good idea .", "User Interface: Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Like uh phones .", "Marketing: Oh yeah .", "Project Manager: Different colours . Okay ,", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: so y you just make it th through  You look through it ?", "Marketing: A see-through . Mm , that's cool .", "User Interface: Yeah . Uh as an option maybe .", "Project Manager: Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top ,", "User Interface: It's the standard", "Project Manager: and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there .", "User Interface: Yeah , uh  Yeah ,", "Marketing: But you have  You had a lot of different buttons .", "User Interface: we but we don't  We don't really have any complicated buttons .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Yeah , maybe you have you have to  Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .", "User Interface: Yeah okay , but  Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little", "Project Manager: O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it .", "User Interface: No , I don't need don't need  Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right .", "User Interface: I use teletext as well .", "Industrial Designer: So uh", "Marketing: No , I use te teletext every day , I think .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm . Okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons ,", "Marketing: Mm .", "User Interface: I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: 'Cause  simple buttons .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: If you put one above it , it's clear .", "Project Manager: Okay .

So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those  the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .

Yeah .", "Marketing: Right .

{"meeting_id": "m_test_20", "domain": "committee", "meeting_transcripts": ["Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies and Hefin David, and we've got no substitutions. Can I ask if Members have any declarations of interest? Can I just, then, declare for the record that I chair the cross-party group on suicide prevention and that Samaritans Cymru, who are appearing before us later, provide the secretariat for that group, just for that to be on the record? Item 2, then, is an evidence session for our inquiry on education otherwise than at school, and I'm very pleased to welcome our panel of witnesses this morning: Sharon Davies, head of learning, Torfaen County Borough Council and representing the Association of Directors of Education in Wales; Nick Williams, director of education, Swansea city and county council, and representing the Association of Directors of Education in Wales; and David Hopkins, interim head of education at the Welsh Local Government Association. Thank you very much, all of you, for attending. We've got a lot of ground we'd like to cover, so we'll go straight into questions, if that's okay.\u00a0And if I can just start by asking you what you believe the main reasons are for the increase in the number of exclusions from school.", "Nick Williams: I'll start, if that's okay. I think one of the things we're experiencing across the system in Wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour. I think the prevalence of ASD\u2014autism spectrum disorder\u2014and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge. Obviously, I can speak more about my own local authority in Swansea: the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five, six years, so what's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well, and the system's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that, so that is placing pressure on schools and then, in turn, pressure on the EOTAS, including our pupil referral units, because, obviously, we just probably haven't got enough capacity at the moment in the system.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Anybody got anything to add to that, or\u2014?", "Sharon Davies: No, I think that's what we're seeing in Torfaen as well. I'd second that.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. So, to what extent, then, do local authorities have clear strategies for support and reintegration, and a continuum of provision to meet the needs of learners who are either at risk of exclusion, or disengagement?", "Nick Williams: Well, we've just developed a behaviour and well-being strategy, which, with our schools\u2014and I'm aware, because I work in the south-west and mid Wales region, and I know some of the other local authorities have something similar, and, similarly, I chair the EOTAS network across Wales, and I know many local authorities are going in that direction, so that has a tiered approach, or staged approach, or whichever, so that there's universal provision. I think it's something that\u2014you know, we need to make sure that our staff and our schools are well-equipped to meet these needs, but there will always, unfortunately, be some learners who need more specialist provision. So, it's equipping them with those sorts of skills, really. I think it's certainly moved forward from where we were two of three years ago. But there's a little bit of lag in the system, trying to bring everybody up to the same, consistent level. But I think work is afoot in nearly all local authorities, as far as I'm aware.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. In terms of school accountability measures, do you think that they have had an impact on the rise in exclusions?", "Sharon Davies: When we're looking at the accountabilities, there's a huge amount of pressures on schools to perform, and I think the whole culture that the schools are within does play an element of it to some\u2014. There is a shift in that culture. We are seeing a change with the interim measures coming on board, but I think there's going to be a lag in the system before we see that having a knock-on effect on our learners, because, undoubtedly, there are pressures on schools.", "Lynne Neagle AM: So, you've seen an improvement since the capped 9 has been brought in?", "Sharon Davies: I think it's early to say,\u00a0but certainly we're working towards that improvement. I can only speak for Torfaen\u2014we've been working really hard on our exclusions and working with our schools to ensure that the curriculum is broad and balanced, and accounts for every learner within the system.", "Nick Williams: May I answer this in Welsh?", "Lynne Neagle AM: Of course, yes.", "Nick Williams: The messages that the Government is conveying to us and the messages we convey as directors and councils are important as well. So, we always tell them that it's the progression of the children in the future that's important, not just reaching up to the level. So, it's more complex than that, and it's important to share that. And in fairness to Estyn\u2014Estyn has changed its mind as well. So, messages such as those are being conveyed now, and I think that the schools do understand now the expectation and what's expected of them.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. In terms of parents, what are local authorities doing to actually engage parents of children and young people who are either EOTAS or at risk of becoming EOTAS?", "Nick Williams: I'll answer this in English. Again, I know perhaps Swansea\u00a0and Neath Port Talbot\u2014we have a team-around-the-family approach. So, as you say, it's more complicated than just the child behaving in a certain way, or being school-anxious, whatever the issue is. So, it's sort of bringing all of the agencies together to try and look at how we can proactively solve problems and support the families. Because nearly always, the behaviours that are demonstrated, or come out in schools, or whatever provision, is obviously probably greater in the home environment, so there's a whole\u2014. We understand the complexities and the need for a whole-family, almost, approach to support.", "Lynne Neagle AM: And do you think that all local authorities have got that understanding across Wales?", "Sharon Davies: I would say the majority have.", "Nick Williams: Yes.", "Sharon Davies: Yes, it's quite common practice. As Nick mentioned, it is about that multi-agency approach\u2014it is working with social care, working with health colleagues, to look at the whole package that goes into these families and to our learners.", "Nick Williams: Certainly with schools, I know across Wales we've done a lot of training on adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed practice, so at least people can perhaps better understand some of the reasons why this behaviour is coming through, whereas in the past\u2014I'm thinking myself, now, as a teacher\u2014they were just difficult behaviours. I didn't really know the background to possibly why those behaviours were coming through. So, I think we are more informed as a profession.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on funding from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: May I begin, maybe, with a question, generally speaking\u2014? We're all aware of the funding issues and the challenges of funding that face schools in general. So, can this lead to more exclusions, because additional learning needs have been hit in light of these challenges, and then that the side-effects of that creates more exclusions?", "Sharon Davies: In particular now with the new Act coming into force, that's going to place more pressure on the system. In Torfaen, we know that we have schools that are looking at their funding\u2014they are behind, and they have to make these hard choices. And sometimes, they have to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners, then, and that does place additional pressure on the schools.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Is the additional learning needs sector being adversely affected, worse than\u2014?", "Sharon Davies: I'm not sure whether it's being worse affected, but certainly there's pressure, in particular with the new Act coming in, and that's going to place more pressure on the system.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: But maybe we need to spend more in light of the new Act?", "Sharon Davies: Yes.", "Nick Williams: Yes, certainly.", "Sian Hughes: What is your experience, then?", "Nick Williams: The same, really. But just sometimes, the Government doesn't think about the staff in the pupil referral units, because we've gone back to the Government to tell them, 'Right, you've provided money to school staff, but what about staff that need training\u2014perhaps more than staff in the school sector?' And in fairness, they have addressed that, but perhaps it's not at the forefront of their minds when they're thinking of providing funding to the schools. So, it's a little bit of an afterthought. But this will be needed in the future, certainly.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And maybe I can ask the WLGA: are the difficulties that can arise between the money that is kept back by local authorities and the funding that goes directly to schools\u2014can that therefore affect the kind of provision that's happening from authority to authority?", "David Hopkins: Yes, sure. The delegation levels are already very high in most authority areas, and we've got agreements in place with the Government to make sure that more money, or as much money as possible, is devolved to schools. So, I don't think that's a direct factor. I think the factors that really affect exclusions, which is where I think the question came from: you've got the very narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment, which I think has put pressure on some schools, certainly, and headteachers have felt that\u2014sometimes excluded, or otherwise put into another school as a consequence, which is regrettable, but that's what's happened. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister has currently made some more money available, if we look at experiences that have happened in England, in particular, because there are direct parallels there with legislation, we know from those experiences that ALN funding has become increasingly under pressure\u2014there have been big issues around tribunals, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals, because they were losing them time and time again. So, there are financial pressures there, but I don't think the levels of delegation have any impact on that.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. But just the pressures coming in with the new Act et cetera could mean more expulsions.", "David Hopkins: It shouldn't, but it could. It's difficult to know how headteachers and governing bodies will react. If they're under pressure financially or in terms of performance measures, they will react in a particular way. Culturally, we've got to get to the point, I think, particularly with the new curriculum coming in, where we say, 'Look, forget the narrow measures that you're being judged by. We're trying to agree with partners, including Estyn and the Welsh Government, a broader range of measures.' That, in a sense, may provide opportunities for schools, and local authorities, to look more constructively at this whole area. So, that's one area, but you're right, I think the ALN legislation will put pressures on, not just local authorities and schools, but also on the post-16 sector, because we're talking now about a wider age range\u2014doing up to 25 as well. So, we've got a host of issues, I think, there to consider and work our way through.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And is the fact that there's variation from term to term, from week to week sometimes, in the level of provision that a school is going to have to provide for trying to retain those pupils in mainstream schools\u2014is the fact that there is so much variation creating a specific challenge, and maybe that that leads to more exclusions?", "Sharon Davies: As you say, because it changes, it's difficult then to plan ahead, and from year to year and also, as you've said, within the term. Perhaps you have provision for more learners coming in or moving, and then that causes the pressure within the system, then, because you haven't planned for them, and therefore there's no spare funding there to draw on.", "Nick Williams: Also, in fairness to PRUs, we've been trying to work on the fact that, if children move out of school, the funding follows them. We don't want a lag in the system, because they have to meet the challenge of the pupils, but the money is still in the schools, because it's once a year that they have that funding.", "Sian Hughes: Okay, thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. What more can be done, and by whom, to support collaborative working between schools,\u00a0PRUs and local authorities to ensure that there is a continuum of provision and support for learners?", "Nick Williams: Well, one of the things I think that has improved a lot is the networking within the PRU sector. We meet on a regular basis, and that's nationally. And the EOTAS group meets regionally as well. So, there's definitely a better sharing of practice. We put on some very, very good conferences as one form of professional learning. But it's also important\u2014. And we're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider, or it's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits, joint visits, to provision and also using the expertise that we do have within the sector to work more closely with our schools, and vice versa, particularly around the curriculum. And I think this is the opportunity the new curriculum provides, providing our staff have the funding to do that and the opportunities we need to be creating around that as well. But in the past, there might well have been some staff who perhaps hadn't had those school experiences and vice versa.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Can I just ask you about transition arrangements, because I know some of the issues that have arisen in my own constituency is when a pupil is in a PRU and then trying to get back into mainstream education? It isn't a clear, sort of, going from one to the other\u2014sometimes a child can find themselves at home because they're not able to get back into the school setting, the main school setting. How are you addressing that?", "Nick Williams: Well, again, I can only speak for ourselves. We've had a big investment of time, and there will be money and through band B, we're building a brand-new PRU provision in Swansea, which will be open in January 2021. So, we've recognised that, so that we have our staff working very closely with the schools. There's an integration through a part-time timetable back into school, and we continue to support them during that process. But then, when they're back in school, that support doesn't stop\u2014that support continues, and then there's a managed reduction in that support. And that's proven very successful.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: It sounds to me very\u2014. Yes, good\u2014.", "Nick Williams: But I'll be honest with you, the more challenging your learners are the ones who are coming to the end of their statutory education, your key stage 4. It is far, far more difficult when they're 15, 16 to get them back into mainstream. So, then you're looking more at how you transit, then, into further education and colleges and so on.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Thank you. In your view\u2014", "Lynne Neagle AM: Just before we move on, have you got anything to add, Sharon, in terms of\u2014? Because, obviously, we've had the Swansea perspective. I mean, how effective are Torfaen at reintegrating young people into mainstream education?", "Sharon Davies: As Nick said, it does get more difficult at key stage 4, and it's working, then, with\u2014. It comes back to that team-around-the-family approach, to ensure what is needed for that learner to go back into school, what can the school provide. It's looking at the whole package of support, then, that surrounds not just the learner but the family, whether it's transport\u2014it's looking at the whole agenda, then, to ensure that everything is in place for that learner to go back to school, where it's possible.", "David Hopkins: I think, Chair, at least one authority is looking at how they can best retain all pupils in the school setting, but it's early days yet for looking at that. I mean, that's an ideal, obviously, but it does mean looking at your funding constructively and carefully, and it brings\u2014. The principle is fine, but it does bring a host of other issues with it, if you see what I mean. But it's certainly a model worth looking at. It's been tried elsewhere, and we keep an eye on that, but we don't really know what the outcomes have been long term with that.", "Lynne Neagle AM: And which authority is that?", "David Hopkins: I don't think I'm allowed to say at this point.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Oh, okay. And where is it being tried elsewhere? In England, is it?", "David Hopkins: Oxfordshire.", "Sharon Davies: A few years ago, I used to be a primary headteacher in England, so we were looking at different models, then, at various conferences, and I believe Oxford, as a local authority\u2014they had a PRU, and they had discussions with their secondary schools, then, whether to get rid of the PRU, as such, and give the money back into schools. But they looked at a partnership within the schools, then, to say, 'Okay, you can have the money, but there's got to be terms of reference'\u2014not quite a service level agreement, but the schools worked together as a partnership, then, so that they couldn't keep moving the children around, the learners around. It's looking at how well that worked. It started off really well, but that was a few years ago, so I don't know whether it's continued now. But that was a model that, at the time, that local authority looked at to get more money into schools and to get schools, then, to have that responsibility\u2014that they didn't offload the learners elsewhere.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Nick, you wanted to\u2014.", "Nick Williams: Yes, sorry. We do something similar in Swansea. We've operated this now for almost three years, where we devolve\u2014the word is 'devolve', as opposed to 'delegate'\u2014the money to secondary schools to try and give them some extra resource to manage the process, and they have to produce an action plan, which we monitor, about how they're using that funding. But, obviously, we recognise that\u2014and it's back to your original question, the first question\u2014we still have learners, unfortunately, despite pretty effective support and provision in nearly all our schools, because of the very, very challenging behaviour we're experiencing, who do need additional and bespoke support, which in fairness the school can't provide. So, it's a mixed economy, if you like, in Swansea.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Janet.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. So, in your view, though, what are the reasons for the delays that some children experience in accessing EOTAS\u00a0provision?", "Nick Williams: Capacity\u2014", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: What? Sorry, I missed that.", "Nick Williams: Sorry. Capacity: we just haven't got enough spaces in some cases, some year groups and so on. Obviously, given what I've said as well, and I'm sure it'd be the same for all local authorities, we've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision, if you like, the home school. So, there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable, which isn't ideal, I accept, but again, it's working with the families and the youngsters. Also, for us as well we've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion. We have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners. Sometimes, it works really well; sometimes, the learner turns around and says, 'Actually, I preferred it in my old school.' So, there's a cooling-off period as well. I think the learner voice is very important there, because\u2014. We've got to have a package, I think, that is quite wide in its offer.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. What would be the advantages or disadvantages, then, of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for providers, and for EOTAS providers to have approved status?", "Nick Williams: Obviously, we do do that, but we're struggling sometimes for additional provision\u2014very important around safeguarding. However, we don't want to make it too difficult, so that we haven't got any providers coming forward either. So, it's a little bit of a balancing act. But, first and foremost, safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking. But I think, then, we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision\u2014what sort of training and support they have. At the moment, that is a struggle for us, because we're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is\u2014. But, to actually offer some additional training is a challenge.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay, thank you. To what extent do local authorities know about the level of EOTAS provision that is organised by individual schools, whether in an FE college or otherwise off the school site?", "Nick Williams: I can only speak for Swansea. We know, as part of that plan that we ask our schools to send in, they have to put down where that provision is. And obviously, as part of the visits, as well, to the schools by the challenge advisers, the school should be monitoring that provision and quality assuring that provision.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: And how is safeguarding monitored in terms of privately run EOTAS? Independent.", "Nick Williams: The schools would have to make sure that\u2014", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: But is that happening, do you know?", "Nick Williams: Yes, because schools do take safeguarding very, very seriously. They see the importance of it. It's their prime driver in many ways.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And is there a role for local authorities in quality assuring, monitoring or evaluating the EOTAS provision organised by individual schools?", "Nick Williams: Yes, but a lot of the additional provision is provision we also use, in our experience. So, if it's MTP or something through the college, like a mechanics course or something like that, we're probably using it ourselves. So, it is quality assured, if you like, by two sides.", "Sharon Davies: In Torfaen, our secondary schools have set out their own TCP\u2014Torfaen curriculum panel\u2014which looks at alternative provision. So, you've got senior leaders there who attend those meetings. The meetings are facilitated and they're currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school is doing because, sometimes, it's worked in the past, but what they're seeing now is that it's not quite working now, and it's understanding why. Is it due to the complexity of the learners coming through? Or is it that the providers are not offering what the learners are seeking any more? So, it's looking as well at, coming back to that curriculum offer, is it the right curriculum offer for those learners? And the training of the staff, do we have the right staff? It's capacity, then. It's just quality assuring the provision. Just because it's worked in the past\u2014it's about keeping that momentum going.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And should local authorities take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition?", "Sharon Davies: Can I just ask what you mean by individual tuition?", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I suppose individual tuition in terms of each individual, I would assume that means.", "Sharon Davies: Okay.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I wouldn't like to think anyone was falling through\u2014", "Lynne Neagle AM: I think the purpose of the question is around home tuition, yes.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Individual tuition in terms of we wouldn't want any child, if they're away from a main-school setting, to slip through the net in terms of tuition, or safeguarding even.", "Sharon Davies: I suppose the difficulty with home tuition is, as a local authority, we're restricted on how much access we get into the home.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Well, I appreciate that, and that's the\u2014[Inaudible.]", "Sharon Davies: Therefore, it's really difficult then to quality assure, because unless the families invite us in there's very little\u2014. We are restricted in that respect.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: What about if they're in a private setting?", "Nick Williams: If they're following a restricted timetable or whatever, because maybe they're school anxious and so on, and we're trying to get them into our provision like that, the home-tuition staff work for us. We don't use agency staff, for instance, to go in and provide a few hours of provision, or to go to the local library. So, for whatever reason their needs at the moment can't be met in a school or in approved provision, then the staff who do provide some education, or if it's for medical reasons, they work for us in the local authority. So, we're not using\u2014", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Is that widespread around Wales?", "Nick Williams: I don't really know the answer to that, I'm sorry. I can only speak for Swansea.", "Sharon Davies: We're very similar to that.", "David Hopkins: Historically, there has been a general pattern, and if you're making a provision you will quality assure it, clearly. I think your question is probably about other forms of provision and how do you quality assure those.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Absolutely, yes.", "David Hopkins: And that's more difficult to answer, I suspect.", "Lynne Neagle AM: What we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority, but I think Nick has answered that now, really, if that's a consistent answer for local authorities.\u00a0Can I just ask, before we move on, in the WLGA paper, you say you're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are EOTAS and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working'. Can you expand on those concerns for the committee?", "Nick Williams: I think it's, you know\u2014", "Lynne Neagle AM: It was the WLGA paper, actually.", "David Hopkins: It was a joint paper. You go on.", "Nick Williams: It's about getting that money following the learner and so on, and that shared ownership of the learner that the schools need to keep, because we want them reintegrated back into schools\u2014that's the aim of any provision that we put in. It's not permanent\u2014except, for certain learners, that might be the case\u2014so they're still, if you like, part and parcel of the school. I think one of your other colleagues asked about the off-rolling, if you like\u2014another term that's used\u2014of students when they get to GCSEs\u00a0so they don't count in schools' data. We're trying to very much move away from that, through the messages that we all give our schools. The messages that governors and headteachers then give to their staff. So: 'They're our learners. They're the most vulnerable learners we've got.' And for the individuals, for the families, and for society, if we can't support these learners\u2014we know the links then to crime, and the cost to us as a society as well. So, it's in all our interests to do the very best for these learners.", "Lynne Neagle AM: You won't get any arguments from us on that. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian has got some questions on the curriculum.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I just want to discuss a little about the curriculum as it stands, and thinking about transferring to a new curriculum, of course. What are the challenges? I'll begin with the WLGA, in general, and ask you, in both your areas, what are the challenges to ensure that EOTAS learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum, and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them? What are the challenges associated with that?", "David Hopkins: In general terms\u2014. You differentiate there between EOTAS and PRUs. PRUs: clearly, we know that they are following a set curriculum; they are inspected; they are under the control of the local authorities. So, we're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there. Where home tuition is provided through the local authority, as has been discussed, again, there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving. You can't always guarantee what then happens in the home. As you say, particular things happen there, and they may not get that. But that's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle. It's more difficult where, I suspect, it's being provided by a third party that's been commissioned. The commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place; it's all about the monitoring then. But that's a very general, broad-brush answer. I couldn't give you a definitive one of what's happening across Wales. My colleagues can probably tell you what's happening in their localities, and that would be helpful. But in general: PRUs, yes, we'd be satisfied; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority, yes, we would be satisfied; other areas, we would not be able to give a definitive answer on, is my guess.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And does that worry you?", "David Hopkins: Me?", "Sian Gwenllian AM: The WLGA.", "David Hopkins: Of course it's a concern. If you can't guarantee quality in any shape or form for a young person, it is a concern.", "Nick Williams: In the region, we do collaborate with each other in terms of staff training. Certainly, they also work with school staff as well. So, the developments are quite positive currently, but there is work to do, I agree.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: In terms of the how curriculum is at present, are you happy that it's being delivered?", "Nick Williams: To be honest, we are\u2014", "Sian Gwenllian AM: In the PRUs?", "Nick Williams: To be honest, they are broad and balanced. They have to be broad and balanced currently. But there's working together now in terms of the new curriculum, and using the opportunity that exists now to collaborate with school staff as well.", "Sharon Davies: Collaboration, I think, is the answer, between the PRUs and the schools. Collaborate and have joint working to ensure that the learners have what they need.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I can see how collaborative working with the units can work\u2014because they're under your control\u2014the problem is the other parts of the system, in a way.", "Nick Williams: They're not with other people all the time; they just go for something So, they would still have literacy and numeracy and Welsh\u2014that would still be provided in the PRU. So, they're not out all the time.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: No, it's beyond the PRUs I'm talking about. If a pupil is in a PRU, you are telling me that they have the curriculum. But for those who are in homes, or in private provision, perhaps who are not in your experience\u2014. Maybe, this morning, we're getting a picture of the best practice, and we're not going under the surface to where things aren't as good in some areas. Do you agree that there is that inconsistency? What we're hearing about now are the best elements.", "Nick Williams: Consistency is developing across Wales.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: With the curriculum?", "Nick Williams: Yes, and in terms of collaboration. I'm not saying that it's perfect, but it is developing.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you, Si\u00e2n. Questions now from Dawn Bowden.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. It's really around support. It follows on a little bit from what Si\u00e2n was saying. Can I also just refer back to the point that David was making earlier on about ALN and the extent to which ALN support is available to learners in EOTAS? The information that we've had is that it's difficult enough in mainstream schools, but in an EOTAS setting, it's particularly challenging. So, how can that be improved? What can we do to address that? The reason I'm saying that is there are particular needs of learners in an EOTAS setting\u2014that's why they're there, quite often. So, it's almost more important that that ALN provision follows them through.", "David Hopkins: If a child has additional needs, of course they should be met, whatever the setting. But I take your point. There's a possibility that\u2014. Again, going back to the previous question, we would know within, say a PRU or any local authority commissioned or delivered tuition\u2014whatever form that took\u2014then those needs definitely should be being met. I can't tell you hand on heart whether they all are or not\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014but they should be. Once you get out of that very tightly regulated part of the system, then, again, if a child has a particular need, of course that need should be met, but it becomes increasingly difficult. So, I think there possibly is an issue there, but I don't know whether my colleagues have a greater understanding of that. But there certainly may well be an issue there.", "Dawn Bowden AM: There is a disconnect between what should be happening and what actually is happening, isn't there? Even in some local authority PRUs where we expect all of this to be happening, we know that it\u2019s not; we know that the full curriculum is not being provided either. The basic numeracy, literacy and well-being stuff is taking place, but there is discrepancy of provision, even in local authority commissioned EOTAS provision.", "David Hopkins: I think there will be variations in provision, but I would say that, within the local authority maintained sector, that provision should be being made. If it's not, the local authority concerned should be aware of that and should be dealing with that.", "Nick Williams: We've probably\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014in Swansea if you look at the inspections of the provision. Going back some years, they weren't\u2014 What you're describing, it was true. However, the most recent inspection is very positive, and not that we recognise that there's no work to be done; we're not being complacent. But to answer your question, I think the biggest challenge is the capacity. So, I suppose that comes down to additional funding, because I'd like a dedicated educational psychologist spending their time possibly only with our PRU youngsters and EOTAS provision, but we haven't got the capacity because of the demands on us from the wider system.", "Dawn Bowden AM: And\u2014. Sorry, go on.", "Sharon Davies: It's kind of what Nick said about capacity, but it's also ensuring the right staff as well, because sometimes, you may have them, but if they move on, or retire, or whatever, there's not a bus load, if you like, of people with that expertise. Because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise, and therefore, it's quite niche, and once that person has moved on, it's really difficult to start all over again.", "Dawn Bowden AM: I understand that.", "Sharon Davies: Absolutely. It's more than just one person\u2014it's the whole training package that goes around that capacity as well.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, and I'll come back to that in a moment.", "Nick Williams: But I think that's something we could do better. I think we need to be more\u2014. Because that's not just down to money, it's making sure that we perhaps offer, through our teacher training colleges, the opportunity for them to spend some time. At the moment, a newly qualified teacher can't work in this type of provision, which you can argue, that's fine, they need to perhaps get mainstream first. But we need a group of people in the future to fill those gaps. So, that should be built in to their teacher training, and even through their ongoing professional development, both ways\u2014staff actually coming out to schools, going into our provision and vise versa\u2014because you can also get very isolated if you've worked in PRUs for\u2014. You've got very specialist skills, but you perhaps need those wider experiences as well. So, we could be doing more there, and I think that's probably, the group I chair, a discussion we need to have.", "Dawn Bowden AM: And on that point, actually, we did hear from Estyn the point you were making about the staff leaving and there are very small numbers of staff working in that provision. There really isn't the capacity for them to access professional training. Is that your experience? And if so, what can we do about that?", "Sharon Davies: I think it's limited. I think it is getting better, as Nick mentioned. There are networks now, there are conferences. It is an improving picture, but I think it's limited.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, okay. So, is there any way that local authorities can encourage specialist teachers and educational psychologists to actually share expertise with independent providers of EOTAS?", "Nick Williams: Yes, but again, it's a capacity issue, because if we take them out of the provision, it's difficult for perhaps a supply teacher to come in and manage that class because of the demands. So, it's not an easy conundrum.", "Dawn Bowden AM: No. But you're saying, really, take it back to teacher training and start at that point so that every teacher has at least some basic awareness of dealing with education in that setting. I understand that.", "Sharon Davies: Or whether there's an opportunity, if somebody wants to lead into that more, that there's an opportunity to do it; that there's an offer there, if they want to specialise more into that area. But at the minute, there isn't that option.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Can I just take you back to pupil support? We talked about ALN. What about access to mental health services? What's your experience of EOTAS learners' access to mental health support?", "Nick Williams: Again, even in the region there's variation there because we've got three health boards over the footprint of the south-west and mid Wales region. So, it varies. That's my understanding, anyway, and I think that's similar across Wales. Ours hasn't been great, to be honest with you. And that's one of the positive steps, that health boards have to have a DECLO\u00a0now\u2014don't ask me, I can't remember what the exact abbreviation is\u2014but we've met with the designated education clinical lead officer, and I think those partnerships will be strong in the future. But it's also us then having a well-being strategy and support that is universal. So, there's counselling and so on to make sure that the learners are going through, if you like\u2014. Not that we're trying to stop them going through, but we're trying to deal with them appropriately at the different stages so that they're not inundated either.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, of course. But is your experience also that a lack of mental health support in mainstream schools could potentially be leading to more learners ending up in an EOTAS provision.", "David Hopkins: I was going to say, about the question, I think there's a general deficit in child and adolescent mental health services, for example. I'm not criticising the services, I'm just saying the capacity isn't there, as we would like. So, I think there's probably a more general issue there that would, in turn, translate into pupils who've got additional needs, whether they're in EOTAS, PRU or wherever. I suspect\u2014I've not got an evidence base to offer you, but there's a very long-standing problem there.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Si\u00e2n, you had a supplementary.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. Just to return to teacher training, and you say that new teachers can't go straight into a unit, and maybe more emphasis is needed on that aspect. But generally speaking, if there's an increase in challenging behaviour, are new teachers able\u2014? They don't have the experience, but are they equipped well enough to deal with that? Because we hear of so many people leaving the profession because of this challenging behaviour, and again, I wonder if the system has adequately caught up with that. And we need\u2014not just in this aspect\u2014but we need to look at the system holistically to be more prepared to deal with challenging behaviour. Do you know what I'm saying?", "Nick Williams: It's not just\u2014. If people decide not to go into teaching after having training, it's not just because of challenging behaviour. There is a change now. There is more time for students in schools, so that helps. You need the theory, but also the practice\u2014that's important to have somebody who can mentor you in the school and that shows good practice. Then there are the policies that the school uses to assure that there is consistency across the whole school.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: But if we're facing a situation where there are fewer wanting to go into the profession and we are losing those most experienced people, then it creates a great big challenge, doesn't it? We're looking at something very limited here, but we need to look at it in the bigger picture of what's happening. Would you agree with that?", "Sharon Davies: Yes, certainly.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Sharon, the CAMHS in-reach project is operational in Gwent,\u00a0but my understanding is that they don't include PRUs. Is that right?", "Sharon Davies: I don't know if that is the\u2014.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, that's fine, that's my understanding. I just wanted to ask, then, the Gwent attachment team has been working with PRUs in Gwent, and the committee is familiar with the work of the Gwent attachment team, can you just tell us what you think the impact of that has been in terms of support for staff and embedding that awareness of attachment and early trauma in the PRUs?", "Sharon Davies: I think any form of professional learning, it's positive, and, therefore, as we alluded to earlier, it's that expertise training for the PRU then and for the staff there. It's having a positive impact. At the minute, I don't know what the overall impact is. I think it's early days, but it seems to be positive.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Janet, I think some of the areas have been covered. Is there anything you want to pick up from the\u2014?", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, I think the rural aspect\u2014are you aware that there are any issues relating to transport for EOTAS learners, particularly in more rural parts or areas of Wales?", "Nick Williams: Certainly, in our region, in Powys, from north Powys, when you're almost in Oswestry, down to Ystradgynlais, which is not far from me. So, you've got provision for those types of learners there. I think they've got provision in the north and south of the county, but you're still talking\u2014", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: What provision in the north?", "Nick Williams: I think there's a PRU\u00a0provision in the north of Powys and one in the south\u2014", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Oh, sorry, north of Powys.", "Nick Williams: North Powys.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Oh, sorry, I thought you meant north Wales. Sorry.", "Nick Williams: Sorry. But even so, the distances that those learners are having to travel are huge.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, I've got a\u2014. It's a big issue.", "Nick Williams: For myself, and I'd hazard a guess, Torfaen, we're relatively compact, aren't\u00a0we, so it's not such an issue.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Has the WLGA got any comment on the transport issue?", "David Hopkins: I'm not aware of issues, if I'm honest, but then again, it may be something we've not investigated. I'm quite happy to look at that.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. We've come to the end of our time. We have probably got a few areas that we'll write to you about, if that's okay. Can I thank you for your attendance this morning? We will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for attending. The committee will break until 10:20, but can Members not shoot off for a sec, please? Okay, can I welcome everybody back to our next evidence session, which is our sixth evidence session for our inquiry on education otherwise than at school? I'm very pleased to welcome Sarah Stone, executive director for Wales of Samaritans; Liz Williams, policy and communications officer at Samaritans; and Dr Ian Johnson, who is the manager of children and young people's mental health at Mind Cymru. Thank you all for attending. If it's okay, we'll go straight and questions. If I can just start by asking you what you think the main reasons are why we are seeing this increase in the numbers of children and young people being excluded from school.", "Sarah Stone: I think you were going to\u2014.", "Dr Ian Johnson: I think it's a very difficult subject, because, in many cases, we're not really sure what the data looks like. We get these things from quite a broad perspective, and we don't actually see the extent of the reasons why. If you look at, for example, the statistical release, then you get a sense of why people are being excluded, but they tend to be\u2014. It's a very reductionist discussion, so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour, verbal abuse or physical assaults, but you don't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that. Now, we know that that information exists, because, obviously, schools don't exclude anybody lightly, and I speak as someone who's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools. So, there's a great deal of paper trail, but that doesn't seem to really find its way up to a higher level.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And how concerned are you about the trend that we're seeing of an increase in younger children being excluded, and what do you think the reasons might be for that?", "Dr Ian Johnson: I think it's very concerning that we're seeing increases amongst younger children in particular. Those have gone up quite substantially in the past few years, and a lot of the evidence that we're hearing is quite anecdotal, so it tends to be around the behavioural issues or underlying issues, and there's a lot of discussion about the adverse childhood experiences agenda and how that's\u2014. So, there's a better understanding of that, but I'm not in a position at the moment, really, to be able to explain why primary schools maybe are actually taking that position and excluding more than they used to.", "Sarah Stone: What I would say is that the reason that Samaritans did our report on exclusions from school rested with\u2014. They began with anecdotal information coming through to us around individual distress and from projects working with young people who'd been excluded. And there are projects that are working with young people who are being excluded\u2014I mean primary school children. And the major thing we say in our report is that we\u2014. So, this is enough to ask us some serious questions, to which we don't know the answer, unless we actually do some serious work on this. So, I would reiterate what we say in our report: that we need to examine this. It's a really important issue, and the life trajectory of those young people is being impacted by their exclusion.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. You may not be able to answer this, but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions?", "Dr Ian Johnson: Well, I think it's very interesting, looking at Estyn's pupil registration practices report from October last year, which looks at off-rolling, and I think that you see, specifically at year 10 to 11, a strong impact: around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11, but you're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9, year 9/year 10. So, I think it's clear that there's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11, but what I think is concerning for me is the normalisation, throughout the system, at secondary school level, where there's off-rolling between year 7/8, year 8/9. Based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort, then you're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year, and I think we need to understand why that is the norm, what could be done around that, as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11. The Estyn work is quite factual. It's looking at the numbers. I think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there's a specific reason why schools are doing that, related to the accountability measures. It'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera, but I think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that's currently available.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you.", "Liz Williams: I think there's also a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children who are particularly vulnerable. So, I suppose, if you consider that, this is something that definitely needs to be looked at further so that there's incentive for schools to keep children who are perhaps demonstrating challenging behaviour or perhaps aren't attaining brilliant grades. So, I think that's something that needs to be looked at further.", "Sarah Stone: And, just finally, if that's okay, just to cross-refer the committee to the loneliness and isolation strategy, to which we made extensive representations on this issue. A part of the strategy talks about using our approach to accountability to recognise inclusive schools and reduce incentives to remove pupils from schools. So, that is a commitment in that strategy. It's a really important commitment to make a reality of that, because, actually, what is happening, I think, is that there are incentives that are perverse around this issue.", "Dr Ian Johnson: Could I just come in on that? I think there's an interesting, again, qualitative, quantitative, element to what happens to those children who move into PRU,\u00a0EOTAS provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career. So, I think there's a question, then, about\u2014I was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8, 8/9, et cetera, and how they loop back into the mainstream education system, what happens to them, but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into EOTAS, PRU provision, and what happens to those young people afterwards? I'm sure we'll pick up some of that as we go through.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders around the support for learners who are at risk of becoming EOTAS.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Good morning. To what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming EOTAS?", "Sarah Stone: Okay. So, this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did, and we came up with a range of suggestions. I think the quick answer is that what we've seen is a strong indication that it isn't, and that it's\u2014. But also that it's not simply a question of the young person, that it's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing. So, there are a couple of big things to say on this one. One is that we want to promote a compassionate response and an informed response by everybody in the school to distressed young people\u2014and that distress may show in a number of ways, not necessarily just as obvious distress. So, I think it's understanding that, having a confident response and, obviously, this links with expressing suicidal thoughts and distress as well, which may not come out in exactly that way\u2014but being able to respond where young people are expressing suicidal thoughts. And I think if we connect this with the agenda around adverse childhood experiences, and if you see the young person\u2014. I think what we as Samaritans really wanted to do was to focus on the distressed individual\u2014that's what we do, it's what we're majorly about. So, a young person who is experiencing a whole range of adversity in their own life may be presenting at school in a very challenging way, perhaps. That school may also be their only safe place, and I think that's just a really simple thing just to keep remembering. Hearing headteachers and teachers talk about this, a lot of them are very aware of that, and there are some great examples of schools working to reduce exclusions and understanding the fork in the road that exclusion or not exclusion represents in the life of that young person. There are restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in Cardiff that seem extraordinarily inspiring. I've heard\u2014. There's been so much interest in this piece of work that we've done, and I've spoken to many educators since, and so it's doing what we needed to do, which is to get people talking about it. Because I think it's not about providing a simplistic answer to this question of support, it is understanding that it's a whole-school question. It's building on the excellent work that is being done by schools in different parts of Wales, joining that up and making that much more general. So, I think that's the opportunity: is to really recognise that this is a big issue, and that, if you don't hold young people within an educational setting, the lifetime consequences for them, including their elevated risk of suicide\u2014it's very hard to reverse that. So, I think we want to focus on a distressed young person and how we respond to that, and it's amazing to move someone on from where they started, and loads of teachers will tell you examples of how they've done that and how they've felt that's not sufficiently recognised by the measures that they're subjected to.", "Dr Ian Johnson: I think it's an issue where it's very important both to focus on the individual, but also on the macro situation, and, as Sarah mentioned, I think the whole-school approach, which is something that's been discussed within this committee, as part of the 'Mind over matter' work, is something that is hugely important. And that's why that should be\u2014there should be statutory provision regarding a whole-school approach. Because understanding\u2014. That prevention operating all the way through the whole-school community will, hopefully, be very effective in providing support levels, ensuring that that support is in place from the very beginning, all the way through primary school, all the way through secondary school, to ensure that learners are being supported and that that is something that's at the forefront of people's considerations whenever they're considering what a pupil is doing, and why they might be doing it. And that then also links back into consideration around adverse childhood experiences. But, generally, just that thinking about the behaviour and the emotional response first, I think, is hugely important in this context.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And what do you think could be done more, and by whom, to help schools to support pupils to remain in mainstream education?", "Sarah Stone: So, this is where we set out nine recommendations in our report and I think the major message is, as I said before, that we don't have a simple answer to this one. However, there are a number of things that we need to do: we need to recognise the impact of adverse childhood experiences; we need to train teachers so that they have an understanding response and are much more confident in that; we need to learn from what works; we need to listen to the voices of young people themselves. That's terribly important, because\u2014. I know this committee is very well aware of that, because you've done very good work listening to the direct voices of young people, but they are very often able to articulate quite a lot about what is needed. I would also add to that that we would want young people themselves to be skilled up in understanding and recognising their own emotions, because this is about putting in place that awareness, that consciousness, if you like, about being able to name and recognise feelings. There's great international evidence on the importance of that and the benefit of it, which was carried out when the new curriculum was being developed, and the health aspect of that. So, we've kind of done that work in Wales. What we would like to see is that new curriculum around health and well-being and mental health and awareness being in the curriculum, so that young people, on a statutory basis\u2014. Otherwise, you're entrenching the differences and the inequalities between teaching across Wales, because the good will do it, and perhaps others will find it much harder. So, that's a major message as well. So, I think there's a menu, if you like, and some of it is very much about respecting the experience of teachers and of schools and working with them, because this is about working with their will to do things well.", "Dr Ian Johnson: I think what's important, and maybe it's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools, is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person. So, that has to be taken deeply into consideration. Obviously, the schools provide whatever support they can, but what is the best for the young person at this time? And that answer will differ from individual to individual. I think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this, and it's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this. One of the projects that Mind will be working on in Wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry, where we'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence, because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal, and I think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel, and how they find this. Sarah's referred to the curriculum. I think there's a lot to be done, still, with regard to PRU and EOTAS with the new curriculum, and, hopefully, we'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. And what are your views on the balance between funding being used for diagnosis and support, because I know that the Samaritans report suggested that funding tends to go into diagnosis rather than support? How can the balance be addressed?", "Liz Williams: I think it's a really difficult balance, but it was something that was brought up in the research stages of our report. So, we held a round table during the research period, and participants said that they were particularly concerned about the lack of awareness and knowledge of children who had additional learning needs. And, obviously, this is quite serious because these children are at risk of being excluded and are over-represented in excluded groups. And they were particularly concerned about children who were sort of on the cusp, or not properly diagnosed, and a lot of these children would have things like attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and, again, these made up the cohort of pupils who were excluded. So, when you consider that, you tend to think, actually, diagnosis could be really useful, so that staff are aware of the pupil's needs, and maybe aware of why the child might be demonstrating challenging behaviour. However, what participants did say was that unless there was a proper understanding of the child's condition or additional learning needs, and that the proper support was there, then diagnosis alone wasn't of value. So, I think one of the participants said that up to 50 per cent of learners in a classroom could have an additional learning need, so, again, if the support isn't there, that child isn't going to benefit from diagnosis. And what was really highlighted is the importance of the school being inclusive, and for that child, regardless of whether they had an additional learning need or not, to have proper opportunity to progress.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. And, then, to what extent are schools aware of the impact of early trauma ACEs, and how are schools adapting their practices to take account of them?", "Dr Ian Johnson: I don't think we're really capable of saying that on an individual level. We're aware, as you've heard from previous evidence from heads of education, et cetera, directors of education, that work is going on on an all-Wales basis, and there's obviously an awful lot of work that's going on on the ACEs agenda. I referred to being a previous school governor, and that's somewhere that's become a trauma-informed school, and they have established that and are widening that base. I think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back, as I said, with the curriculum changes as we're going forward. There's a concern that I have at the moment regarding the progress on EOTAS and PRU within the new curriculum, and there's work that I think will still need to be done, and something that I'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment Bill when it comes forward later on in the year, because there were comments made by the education Minister, I think, in response to Suzy Davies, in the statement in January, that we're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner, to which I have no concern in itself. However, the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage. So, the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience, and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum, is hugely important.", "Sarah Stone: And I think, just to add to that around the impact of early trauma, I think one of the things that we at Samaritans are particularly aware of is the impact of loneliness and isolation on individuals and how that can help to drive distress and suicidal ideation. That sense of belongingness is recognised by the research as being critical to functioning well as a human being. We are social beings. And one of the ways in which early trauma and adversity, if that leads to exclusion from a range of groups, is to lead to lifelong isolation. It's something that comes out when you look at middle-aged men. You look at a trajectory that goes back towards their early years, very often, and Samaritans is about to release some research on that very point. So, there's a connection between what happens in later life and what happens here. There's also, if we look at the numbers of exclusions around boys, and we're looking at much higher suicide rates and numbers of other issues around men\u2014. Again, I think it's important to see this whole picture\u2014", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: It's very bad in north Wales. Our figures are very worrying.", "Sarah Stone: Yes, exactly. So, there's a bigger picture here. I would say that we want to do something to mitigate the impact of adverse childhood experiences, and we have this great opportunity to release the potential of those young people whose, often, strength and resilience is quite extraordinary in circumstances that many of us would find hard to imagine. So, we need to look at the assets that young people have as well, which you can work with. So, I think if there's a real opportunity to create a change, this is one of them. This issue about exclusions and PRUs\u2014this is a chance to make that ambition real.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you so much. Very good.", "Liz Williams: Just to reiterate what Sarah said, looking at our research, which, obviously, isn't yet published but will be soon, it really is quite shocking how these men fell through the net so many times when they were young, and, actually, how many missed opportunities there were to intervene in the cycles of inequality. It is quite clear from that research that these stages where children are demonstrating challenging behaviour are the first signs of distress. So actually, this is where we should be intervening. So, I think like Sarah said, it is really important to see this as a preventative agenda.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Dawn.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. A few questions around providing support for learners. You've set out very clearly what you think needs to happen in your report, your nine points and so on, but what's your view on the support currently provided, both in a school setting and EOTAS settings for mental health support? Have you been able to get that sort of information? Have you got a sense of\u2014?", "Dr Ian Johnson: I don't think we're really in a position to answer fully as to what's going on. I think that part of the problem is there's not really a national picture that we can pick up in terms of data or information regarding this, and I think that's really why there's been such a push towards seeing this in the curriculum.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Sure. So much of your evidence is anecdotal, is it? It's people that have been referred to you, come to you for help, and you just\u2014or your own research. What\u2014?", "Dr Ian Johnson: The research that we're going to do is really where we're at, and that's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general. I think, in particular, we're aware of increases\u2014quite substantial increases in some cases\u2014regarding self-harm, and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys. Specifically, I think there's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range, but we're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools. My experience of projects that I've been involved in\u2014I was previously in front of this committee as part of the Time to Change Wales project\u2014was that, overall, it depends quite strongly on the senior management team and their commitment. Where the SMT has taken a lead, then it feels that schools are really doing something. Where the SMT are, perhaps, a bit more laissez-faire regarding this, then it feels that maybe schools are not making such a step forward. And to come back to the point, that's why we feel that whole-school approach guidance needs to be statutory, because we'll otherwise reach some quite uneven outcomes, because those who are doing it well will really push ahead and those that are not so engaged will not be helping their pupils in the way that they should be.", "Dawn Bowden AM: I guess the EOTAS or PRU provision is going to be much more challenging then, isn't it, then main school provision. I suppose that was what I was trying to get at as well, whether you get a sense that there may be some progress being made in mainstream schools, is that following through in PRUs and EOTAS provision?", "Dr Ian Johnson: I'll just be honest: right now, I couldn't give you an answer on that. I think that is something that, perhaps, slightly concerns me about the whole field is not being able to get a national feel for these issues. I would suspect that there are pockets of very good practice. I've heard discussions about things being done regionally and nationally, but I think it would be good to be able to see what that best practice looks like and how well it's done.", "Dawn Bowden AM: I appreciate you're not educationalists and you wouldn't necessarily have all of that information, but have you got any sense of\u2014again, whether this is anecdotal or from cases that are referred to you\u2014evidence of schools off-rolling pupils with mental health problems? If you've got any evidence of that, what might the impact of that be on the individuals?", "Liz Williams: Yes, I think that certainly does happen. I suppose we know this anecdotally from Samaritans research, but also I have experience of working in pupil referral units and working with some really vulnerable children, and I think there is a sense sometimes that these children are labelled as naughty and disruptive. So, children who have additional learning needs or a communication problem that potentially is undiagnosed or not really properly understood. I think when children have mental health problems and additional learning needs, often they can find the school environment really difficult. I've worked with children who have told me that they just don't enjoy being in the classroom because they feel incredibly anxious. They don't feel they can contribute to the school environment, they don't feel like they're keeping up with their classmates and, as a result, they demonstrate challenging behaviour so that they can leave the classroom. I think that's very sad. As a result, these children aren't always understood and are off-rolled in some cases. But, like Sarah said earlier, there are certainly examples of really good practice, and I suppose this links in to what approaches schools, pupil referral units and EOTAS should take to vulnerable children with mental health problems. One example I can give you is that, at one pupil referral unit, the children would get really distressed and really disruptive towards the end of the day on a Friday. I suppose that, in some schools, the teachers would have thought, 'This is ridiculous, they're disrupting the lessons', but what the teachers knew is that these children would go home, they would face such adversity, wouldn't always get a meal, would be exposed to things they shouldn't be exposed to, and the teachers were able to respond to that with compassion and empathy. But, obviously, seeing behind behaviour is really, really difficult, and I don't think teachers should have to do this alone, they should be properly trained and properly equipped. Even going up to a child\u2014and I suppose this goes back to mental health support. Ideally, as Samaritans, we would want suicide prevention plans to be embedded in schools and to be part of the culture of schools, but obviously this can't happen if teachers aren't properly equipped and don't have the confidence to go up to a student and ask them if they're struggling. In our compassion in education toolkit, we highlight the importance of asking a child, 'Are you self-harming?', if there are signs; 'Have you tried to take your own life?', if there are signs. But obviously that's a very difficult conversation to have. So, yes, there are certainly examples of best practice, but I do believe that, if school staff aren't properly equipped and trained, off-rolling pupils, especially at key stage 4, where obviously you will hold those grades, is definitely something that they don't necessarily have the incentive to prevent. So it's worth looking at that.", "Dawn Bowden AM: You touched, in the beginning of that response, on children being labelled as naughty. To what extent have you come across that? Is that quite prevalent? Is that quite common?", "Liz Williams: Absolutely, yes. I think it's really down to the school. I think it's down to experience and it's down to the teacher. I think it links up with the question we were asked before about diagnosis and support. Lots of children with communication difficulties especially, if they haven't been formally diagnosed, they are certainly the ones that are deemed naughty, because I suppose people think, 'Well, you should be doing well, you're bright. You should be thriving in school.' But that's not always the case. Children can be incredibly anxious, have mental health problems, obviously, are exposed to ACEs and things that go on at home that not necessarily every teacher would know about. So, I think there are definitely children who are labelled 'naughty', and I think children also play up to that as well. Like I said, if children are very anxious in the school environment and in the classroom, if they know they can get out of the classroom and get into a safe space, they will do that.", "Dawn Bowden AM: And then that labelling of a 'naughty' child is actually the impediment to getting that child the support that they need.", "Liz Williams: Absolutely, yes, and I think that's where formal diagnosis can be helpful. I think the doors are open then to much more school support. So, yes, I think it is down to how the school approach it, and it goes back to the whole-school approach and having emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum. It embeds emotional well-being into the culture of the school, and it means that students might know when they need help, how to be more resilient and helping themselves, and when and how to ask for help from the teachers. So, I think it's really important.", "Dr Ian Johnson: If I can just pick up on one of those points, Mind Cymru conducted a series of focus groups around Wales to inform our response to the new curriculum. One of the comments that I think struck home most strongly with me was a young boy saying that, because the same teacher was responsible for pastoral and behaviour, because he had been labelled as naughty or a troublemaker, he felt uncomfortable in terms of going to that same person within the school in order to disclose the problems he was having, because there was a fear of not being believed or accepted, or it being considered as an excuse for poor behaviour, rather than them being taken seriously. I wouldn't want to over-egg that point, but I think it is an important consideration from a learners' perspective. 'If I disclose a problem, if I want to talk to somebody, are there appropriate considerations within the school setting where I can turn to somebody who maybe I might not have the greatest relationship with in other contexts?' I'd also just like to come back to the off-rolling question if I may, just quite briefly. As I said at the outset of the evidence here, Estyn conducted a piece of work on pupil registration practices that showed a substantially higher amount of off-rolling between year 10 and 11, but also a consistent level\u20141.5 per cent to 2 per cent\u2014in other secondary school years. But we don't have the qualitative material to understand how much of that is related to mental health factors, and how much\u2014because we're in discussion about school accountability\u2014might drive some of that at year 10/11. But we don't know why that baseline of 500/600 young people every year is there within our schools. I think that needs further investigation.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thanks for that. Can I just ask you a couple of other questions about the impact of particular circumstances, and whether you've come across any issues relating to Welsh-medium provision to support the mental health and well-being of learners as an issue\u2014that it's not been available, Welsh-medium support, for those learners? Have you come across that at all?", "Dr Ian Johnson: We haven't necessarily come across it, but we haven't been looking for it either. The Estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from Welsh-medium education to EOTAS. There are a number of potential reasons for that. That can include the complete lack of EOTAS provision within a local area. It could be the socio-economic profile, because exclusions, et cetera, are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals, and in many parts of Wales the socio-economic profile of a Welsh-medium education school is slightly different. We are not aware of any particular work that's been done to examine the needs and the provision of Welsh-medium EOTAS. Therefore, my suspicion, without any particular evidence, would be that it happens on a local authority basis, possibly on an incidental basis, depending on the quality and the ability of staff, and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west Wales.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. We can come back to that again, I'm sure. Do you know whether there's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing EOTAS, again in terms of mental health conditions, if there's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision? Have you got any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, of the impact on that?", "Sarah Stone: Not specifically researched on that situation. I think, again, there is so much that we don't actually know and that we should know a lot more about, but I think there are some things that we can say about delays for young people who are not either in education or in anything else, and they're connected with the issues anyway. So, if you understand that there's a strong link between inequality and exclusion, and that the most likely young people to be excluded have other disadvantages as well, that's a really important issue to understand. So, being out of school or out of education for any time is going to exacerbate those pre-existing inequalities, and I can't emphasis that enough. This is exacerbating this cycle of inequality and disadvantage. So, being outside your peer group makes you vulnerable. It makes you vulnerable, and I guess the longer that continues I would expect the worse that impact and that uncertainty would be. So, there's the impact on loneliness and young people seeking an alternative community to the school one. Since the publication of our report, we have had an extraordinary level of interest from people concerned about crime. So, we've talked to the youth justice board, we've met with the police, there's a huge level of concern about county lines and about home-growing drug gangs, and the fodder that those young people are for people who will engage them in all sorts of activities, which are hugely damaging both to themselves and also to the wider society. So, I think we need to understand there's a lot at stake here for wider society in holding young people, and not allowing gaps to grow where they are not held. I would just refer you to the child death review on suicide and suspected suicide by young people, which came out very recently from Public Health Wales and Swansea University, and that looked at 33 young people who died by suicide over the past few years. One thing that came through that and was reflected in one of their suggestions for action was that those young people had not been held in education or training or employment, had slipped through all sorts of systems, and were extremely vulnerable. So, I think that's a really big message: that we need to try to hold people and not allow those gaps\u2014where they're not held within their society\u2014to lengthen and become really, really difficult. So, I think that's my major message on that particular one.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Can I just ask, as a follow on from that, whether you've got any views on the potential impact of individual tuition on learners' well-being? So, home tuition, for instance: are pupils going to be on their own doing that? That might be in their best interest, or do you have any concerns that it might not be?", "Liz Williams: I suppose we don't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils, but what we do know and something that is of huge concern, I suppose, to most people is that there's no central data on how many young people are home schooled. So, it's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally. Also, it is a concern, if children aren't registered with any school, how they get back into school, how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment, if that's what people think is best for them. So, I think that is a concern: not having that transparency of data. And just to reiterate Sarah's point, I suppose, home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things, so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education, but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion, like loneliness and isolation. That child still isn't with its own peer group. That is something that came out of the men's research, as Sarah mentioned. These men, who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide, weren't always interacting with children their own age, and that did cause problems in later life. So, I think it's definitely something we don't know enough about, but I think we need to know more about.", "Dr Ian Johnson: There are two questions within there, regarding the delay in entering provision and the effect of long term individual teaching. I think there are occasions on which individual tuition will be beneficial, because there may be a reason why somebody is uncomfortable and unable to operate within an educational setting. However, it may be that, on a longer term basis, that is not entirely appropriate. But it's very much an individual matter. What concerns me, I think, is the idea of there being a gap between mainstream education and entering any form of EOTAS provision due to capacity or otherwise, because that is a period in time\u2014. We don't know whether there's the causation of or exacerbation of mental health issues amongst those in EOTAS, but it's clear that\u2014well, it seems intuitive that a gap between being in mainstream education and EOTAS is unhelpful, not least their rights to an education, but also the feelings that young people who are probably in quite a confused and troubled state may have during that gap and how long that gap can endure. I will refer back: there was a recommendation by Estyn in their 2016 report on EOTAS regarding CAMHS support for children within those settings, I don't know whether there's been any particular progress within that\u2014and especially the mixture of issues that may be related to both mental health and also neurodevelopmental issues and whether those are more or less likely amongst this vulnerable part of the population.", "Sarah Stone: Just to draw your attention to it, I think there's an acknowledgment that there's a lot we don't know about this. Again, in the loneliness and isolation strategy, there's a commitment to analyse existing education and health data to explore correlations between exclusions or being educated other than at school and mental well-being, including loneliness and isolation. So, I think that's a very welcome commitment to try to expand our understanding in this area, because there may be some pluses as well as minuses, but actually there is so much that we don't know about this.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We've got some questions now from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. I think some of them have been covered, but\u2014", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Just in general, once a young person or a child has been excluded, is there enough support for them, not just on the educational side, but in general? Are we supporting these young people, these most vulnerable young people, once they're in the position of having been excluded?", "Dr Ian Johnson: I'd say that that's something that's possibly happening locally, but we don't have a national picture. One of the things we have already noted is the time between being excluded and entering some kind of EOTAS provision. So, that in itself\u2014and I've heard people talking about the capacity issues\u2014shows what's happening to these children, at a time when they are most vulnerable because they are outside of the system.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And who should be supporting them? Are we being clear enough with regard to who should be giving them the support? They've been excluded, so obviously the education system has a responsibility, but are we clear enough in terms of who else's responsibility this is, and who should be co-ordinating that support?", "Dr Ian Johnson: The truth is, the responsibility lies on the local education authority in that context, I would say. The point is that, often, these children deal with several other institutions. So, it's incredibly important that any service is interweaved into that setting around the child or the children who are in this situation. More information is needed about this. When I was talking earlier about inclusive education, or some kind of investigation into this, that's the kind of thing I'd look at: how to bridge that gap and what kind of support will be available. I'm concerned, of course, in terms of education, whether there is enough funding available to ensure this. But because this is a very vulnerable group, we need to take responsibility in exactly the same way, perhaps, as corporate parenting plays a role there. We need to look at that kind of system, and how we help these individuals. I know there are figures available on local authorities, but I can't remember them off the top of my head, but maybe that's something to look at.", "Liz Williams: And as Ian just said, although there's a lot of responsibility by the school and the local authority, I suppose some responsibility also sits with the parent as well. But for the parents to support their child, either if they're at risk of being excluded or if the child is already in EOTAS, and that parent wants to make sure that the child is having the best education possible, the parent has to have the right amount of information. They must know where to go for support themselves, and I think that a parent can't necessarily know the rights of their child to education and what their child is supposed to be having if they're not provided with all of the information. And I'm sure this is dependent on the school or dependent on the local authority, but that's something worth thinking about as well.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Any other questions?", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Well, unless you want to sum up\u2014?", "Dr Ian Johnson: Just a comment, really, on the new curriculum and ensuring that EOTAS provision includes this, and how the whole-school approach will work within EOTAS, and how we ensure that the provision is available through the medium of Welsh, as we were referring to earlier, on a national level. Is it possible that it can be worked out within the local consortia, for example? How do we ensure that the teachers\u2014? If it's initial teacher training, or if they're newly qualified teachers, or if they're more experienced, how will this be implemented through the system? Because I think that children in EOTAS situations are usually more vulnerable than others, and therefore there is a need to prioritise their well-being and their mental health. We talk a lot about certificates and so forth, and qualifications, but ensuring everybody's well-being is important, and an important outcome of the work. So, we're thinking of this whole-school approach and how it works within the new curriculum, and this is a vital point for the years to come.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Just before we finish, then, is there anything you wanted to add in terms of what the committee could recommend about professional development for staff that would enhance this provision in this area?", "Liz Williams: Yes, absolutely. I think it's so important for teachers to be equipped with the training and to understand the link between inequality and all the things that come under that term, and challenging behaviour, and I think if teachers are aware of that, and trained properly to deal with that, the risk of exclusion will ultimately lessen. And I think with regard to how that can happen, I think, in some cases, mental health training and mental health awareness training is supplementary at times, with just teacher's training, but I think it should be embedded in the initial teacher's training, so that, more than anything, as well as being equipped with the skills, teachers have the confidence to deal with those really challenging situations.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Ian?", "Dr Ian Johnson: I think that's the importance of a whole-school approach, and that being statutory, because that will ensure that everybody within the school community has that knowledge and awareness and knows what to do and where to signpost people. It means foregrounding and having that in the heart of the school ethos, and I think that turning the school into somewhere that considers mental health and emotional well-being first, rather than waiting for a problem\u2014I think that's the key to improving the well-being of our future generations.", "Sarah Stone: I just think it would be great if the community would recognise the link between inequality, adverse childhood experiences, and the opportunity that there is in avoiding a young person falling out of school, and out of anything, and out of sight. So, I think, the other side of this is that this is a real moment of opportunity to intervene positively.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for your evidence. It's been a really valuable and worthwhile session. As usual, we will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much.

So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .", "Project Manager: So it's fairly easy .", "Industrial Designer: There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before ,", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Succeed in it also .", "Industrial Designer: and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .", "Project Manager: Okay ,", "Industrial Designer: So   Okay , so uh", "Project Manager: good .", "Industrial Designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every TV set . So I think that uh should be clear .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .", "User Interface: And what's the um", "Industrial Designer: I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .", "User Interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or", "Industrial Designer: No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So we can use them . So that's no problem .", "User Interface: For the same costs , it's can be uh in our", "Industrial Designer: Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making", "User Interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh", "Industrial Designer: We can we can make its I think .", "Marketing: Well you could only lit uh the buttons  the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .", "Marketing: Or", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: But I think", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,", "Marketing: Hmm , true .", "User Interface: and not for", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Well , it's not one light , it  there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .", "User Interface: Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .", "Industrial Designer: No no no , no . That's right , that's right .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So  well , this uh should be it .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Um have a think about it .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , Ruud .", "Marketing: Oh , mine is already outdated .", "Project Manager: Okay well ,", "Project Manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .", "Marketing: Since uh", "Project Manager: So any income is welcome .  Input .", "Marketing: Okay , make  Well  Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of   of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Could you step a little bit more to the right ?  Yeah , thank you .", "Marketing: But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .", "Marketing: Uh well , skip this .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Well , it's  this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the  about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones .", "Project Manager: Okay . Well , that's interesting .", "Marketing: Or", "Industrial Designer: Or a find  a finding function ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: you know .", "Project Manager: that's definitely interesting .", "Industrial Designer: That's quite a  yes .", "Project Manager: It uh it separates our product from others uh as well .", "User Interface: Sound signal .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: go on .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Marketing: Well , I just said that . And uh  well , this obvious , and he also said it .", "Project Manager: Okay . So that's what the market tells us .", "Marketing: Uh that's about it , yes .", "Project Manager: Yep . Okay .", "User Interface: The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .", "Marketing: Uh mo uh zap buttons most .", "User Interface: So", "Marketing: Volume , they are  uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So", "User Interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design  The perfect design for those  only those buttons . And first um", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Well , the technical uh  there  I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .", "User Interface: Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering ,  the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?", "Industrial Designer: Well", "Marketing: Yeah , that's uh   a problem . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .  Th that's a bit of  that's a problem .", "User Interface: Another device is not a solution .", "Project Manager: Well", "Industrial Designer: Usually", "Project Manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,", "User Interface: It should be uh uh", "Project Manager: like um turning on and off the the the lights .", "Industrial Designer: Oh yes .", "User Interface: Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .

S and we b we want  to make so it's   is easy as possible for our customers ,", "Marketing: and it's", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: so we should think about", "Project Manager: So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se", "User Interface: I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .", "Industrial Designer: It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .", "Marketing: And b", "Project Manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh", "Industrial Designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,", "Project Manager: Yeah , a peak . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .", "Marketing: So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's true .", "Industrial Designer: Yes ,", "User Interface: But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the TV .

I will .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: because that's his  his field of expertise .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes .

Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .", "Marketing: So  Yeah . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Well , we skip that .", "Marketing: So", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Well , so it just th the basic functions .

We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um  I would like to hear um  maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important .

Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like .

About the voice recognition .", "Industrial Designer: Well", "Project Manager: Well , i it should be easy ,", "User Interface: Well", "Project Manager: that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um  um yeah , some some fancy lights .", "Industrial Designer: Mm yes .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: I think that's what we decided .", "Industrial Designer: So we drop the voice recognition ?", "Project Manager: No no no , we didn't", "Industrial Designer: Or", "Project Manager: but it shouldn't be integrated", "Industrial Designer: Oh .", "Project Manager: yeah , it's  of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now", "Project Manager: No .", "Industrial Designer: or can we decide next meeting ?", "Project Manager: We can decide the next meeting . Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Because I'll have some updated info on that uh", "Project Manager: Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info .

{"meeting_id": "m_test_22", "domain": "product", "meeting_transcripts": ["Project Manager: 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um   Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of  our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think  looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um  so actually I think  Yeah um f  you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of", "Industrial Designer: Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your  to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes", "User Interface: You could change the vegetable , or fruit .", "Industrial Designer: yeah , I can change the vegetable .", "Project Manager: Oh is that broccoli ?", "Industrial Designer: This one's broccoli  .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .", "Industrial Designer: The  it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .", "Industrial Designer: You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but", "Project Manager: 'S a very bright strawberry .", "Industrial Designer: So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .", "User Interface: It's been a l", "User Interface: It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Oh yeah .", "User Interface: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was  or design yet actually , would be the um thing  the locator . How how  so", "Industrial Designer: Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .", "User Interface: Okay so that's just", "Industrial Designer: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere", "User Interface: So you have to have a button on your on your  you have to attach the button to the", "Industrial Designer: Yeah we didn't design that .", "User Interface: Yeah we have  that that has yes yet to be designed .", "Industrial Designer: But it would be coordinating with that of course .", "User Interface: Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango .", "User Interface: So . Tada .", "Project Manager: Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there .  But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed", "Project Manager: I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um   I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be", "Industrial Designer: My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .", "Project Manager: Oh . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and  d I dunno what that means .", "Project Manager: Right .", "Industrial Designer: One side is curved and then the other side is curved .", "Project Manager: Well  yeah . If we're talking about the area just  oh I d I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .", "Project Manager: Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Um and lots of special colours actually .  Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ?", "Industrial Designer: No I think that's alright .", "Project Manager: Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .", "Project Manager: And if we sold a lot of squishy things .", "User Interface: Mm .", "Project Manager: Boo yeah . Okay .  S So  Mm . Did y what did you work on ? The", "Marketing: Um evaluation criteria .", "Project Manager: Okay . Do you wanna", "Marketing: I've got a presentation .", "Project Manager: Okay . I think that's", "Marketing: So I need  where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't  okay . Um the method is  we  well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is  everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And  we we have therefore in total um  We have five  we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table . Can you see this here ?", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Um so the que the questions I've given you  c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .", "Marketing: I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told .", "User Interface: Yeah . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own", "Marketing: Yeah it's in the um  it's in the project documents .", "User Interface: Is it meeting three minutes ? No it's not minutes .", "Marketing: It's called evaluation criteria .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Marketing: And it's under evaluation .", "Project Manager: Huh , the PowerPoint one ?", "Industrial Designer: Hmm ?", "User Interface: Okay . Cool .", "Marketing: Yeah . You've found it all ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So it was um  Yeah true's one .", "User Interface: True's one and false is seven .", "Marketing: Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?", "Project Manager: Um we can do it separately and then discuss it", "Marketing: Yeah okay .", "Project Manager: if if that's what people wanna do .", "User Interface: So it's actually a scale .", "Project Manager: Wait , one is true and", "Marketing: Um ,", "Project Manager: so these are the questions we're answering . And one is", "Marketing: yes it's  if it's fancy you put one ,", "Project Manager: One , right okay .", "Marketing: if it's really unfancy it's seven .", "Project Manager: If it's somewhere in between you put four .", "Marketing: Yeah , something .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Okay .  Does it feel fancy ?", "Industrial Designer: Feels like play-dough .", "User Interface: No .", "Marketing: They shouldn't really be questions . Should be more like  Are the batteries easy to insert ?", "Industrial Designer: I'm gonna say yes .", "Marketing: Yes ? Very very true . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: I imagine they're somewhere on the front . We have a little case that you slip 'em in .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Are we just about ready ?", "Marketing: Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . Do we  um is it necessary ?", "Project Manager: I don't think so . It's", "Marketing: We'll just do um", "Project Manager: yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we", "User Interface: Yeah . Okay .", "Project Manager: Our animals will forever be there .", "Marketing: Yeah . Okay .", "Project Manager: Un unless you feel you need it t to", "Marketing: I don't feel any", "Project Manager: okay okay .", "Project Manager: We'll", "Marketing: right um  Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle .", "Industrial Designer: 'Kay", "User Interface: One .", "Industrial Designer: Five .", "Marketing: Right . Ooh I don't know .", "Marketing: Right . One ?", "Industrial Designer: Five .", "Project Manager: Five .", "Marketing: Five .", "Marketing: Two . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ?", "Project Manager: I I think we should", "Industrial Designer: It's four if you wanna do that .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: It adds to sixteen , so that's four .", "Marketing: Oh no . It adds to thirteen . One five five two .", "Industrial Designer: Oh I thought she said five .", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Marketing: One five five two is thirteen , over four for now . I think that's um  next ?", "User Interface: Um three .", "Industrial Designer: Six .", "Project Manager: Six .", "Marketing: Really ?", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Two .", "Project Manager: I wasn't cheating I swear .", "Marketing: Uh-oh . Right . One point three is", "User Interface: So it's a one was true and seven was false ?", "Project Manager: Uh .", "Industrial Designer: Huh ?", "User Interface: Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ?", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Oh I thought it was the other way round .", "Industrial Designer: Wait a minute .", "Marketing: I really", "Industrial Designer: I thought it was the other way round too .", "Project Manager: So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way", "Marketing: Well uh", "Industrial Designer: Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top  .", "Marketing: Yeah yeah . It was one is true and  false is seven .", "Marketing: I should've kept the table up .", "Project Manager: Oh gosh . Okay . Well", "Industrial Designer: I'll just I'll just reverse them all . It's no problem .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Right , well I'm glad this came out .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I thought you guys hated it .", "User Interface: I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ?", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: No .  Oh that's quite funny  .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay . So , starting again , one point one ?", "User Interface: One .", "Industrial Designer: Say two .", "Project Manager: Three .", "Marketing: Two . Okay , one point two ?", "User Interface: Uh three .", "Industrial Designer: Two .", "Project Manager: Two .", "Marketing: Two . Okay . Um , one point three ?", "User Interface: One .", "Project Manager: One .", "Industrial Designer: One .", "Marketing: Ha .  Two point one ?", "Project Manager: Two .", "User Interface: Uh two .", "Industrial Designer: Uh two .", "Project Manager: Two point  I think I missed two .  Wait , is that two point one ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: One point four , one point five . Okay right", "Marketing: Oh dear , okay . Sorry .", "Project Manager: that's  I have two of them .", "Industrial Designer: Mine has all kinds of problems .", "Marketing: Two and one .", "Marketing: Sorry about that . T two point two , which is one point five .", "Project Manager: One .", "Industrial Designer: Uh three . Wait why did I put three ?", "User Interface: Uh one .", "Industrial Designer: I meant one on mine too .", "Marketing: Okay . Three point one . Is that correct on my slide ?", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah ?", "User Interface: Uh one .", "Industrial Designer: Three point one . I have four .", "Project Manager: Three .", "Marketing: One , four , three , three , three point two ?", "Industrial Designer: Three .", "Project Manager: Three .", "User Interface: Uh . One .", "Marketing: Three point three .", "User Interface: One .", "Industrial Designer: One .", "Project Manager: Two .", "Marketing: Four point one ?", "User Interface: One .", "Industrial Designer: Two .", "Project Manager: Five .", "Marketing: Two .

Um", "Marketing: Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone .", "Project Manager: No no that's um  I think we should look at the ones that  like where s where people said four , where  um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote .", "Marketing: I didn't know how else to do it . Okay . Well the worst ones were three point one .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Do  does every ones have the slide ?", "Project Manager: The", "Marketing: Three point one .", "Project Manager: that was material .", "Marketing: Slide show . Material  technologically innovative , okay . Um ,", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: do you want to change it ? What are the suggestions ? I don't know , anyone ?", "Project Manager: Um", "User Interface: Which one is that again sorry ? Three point one ?", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Yeah that  it's three point one was not that good . Four point one .", "Project Manager: Does the shape", "Marketing: The shape .", "User Interface: I think", "Marketing: Four point two ?", "Project Manager: See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the  is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? It  or bigger ?", "Industrial Designer: I think the wheel would probably be  mm .", "Project Manager: Because", "User Interface: What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?", "User Interface: And like then it  you could hold it in your hand better .", "Industrial Designer: I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish .", "Project Manager: Yeah . No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get  that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: The flat one . Yeah .", "Project Manager: so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .", "User Interface: I didn't  yeah . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat", "Industrial Designer: Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . Mm .", "User Interface: But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah . And would it even resemble fruit that way ?", "Project Manager: I mean", "User Interface: Yeah like certain ones  you'd have to limit the fruit selection ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: like you could probably do a strawberry still .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: I think the broccoli would be out .", "User Interface: You could do  , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like  sorta like a joystick .", "Project Manager: Yeah that I I  when you were holding that before , it actually looked  yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah . That looked really good .", "User Interface: I don't know . So", "Marketing: Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?", "User Interface: Uh .", "Industrial Designer: Not that I can think of . Rhubarb .", "User Interface: Rhubarb .", "Marketing: I think that broccoli is my favourite actually .", "User Interface: These obscure fruits .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Uh despite the", "User Interface: I think we needn't", "Project Manager: What if um the  it was just patterns on like  we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .", "User Interface: Huh ?", "Project Manager: You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .", "User Interface: Oh okay .", "Industrial Designer: So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .", "User Interface: Yeah . That could work .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Or I mean we could even have fruit like around", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: I mean", "User Interface: Yeah . I dunno .", "Project Manager: But if we if we need", "Marketing: Yeah and just have the colour match or something .", "Project Manager: yeah . And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be", "Project Manager: I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the", "User Interface: Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: Mm .", "User Interface: Or like  I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think  see as like", "User Interface: like you could  if it was only this  you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .", "User Interface: So like maybe that's just too big", "Project Manager: Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,", "User Interface: because", "Project Manager: which is a nice kind of", "User Interface: Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: yeah . But", "User Interface: I dunno .", "Project Manager: I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ?", "User Interface: I guess", "Project Manager: 'Cause like kind of", "Industrial Designer: We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits .", "Project Manager: Yeah , yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Or like even", "User Interface: Dif", "Industrial Designer: We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .", "Project Manager: Or even like  Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . You know ?", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do  I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .", "Project Manager: 'Cause that , I think  I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Mm .", "Project Manager: And you could  like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Alright .", "Project Manager: But I mean it  do we have any other ideas about that ?", "Marketing: Um", "User Interface: We could tr I don't know .", "Marketing: Think the critical ones came out to be  yeah that one .  . Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,", "Marketing: which can be easily  I think that's not a problem any more .", "Project Manager: The batteries are going in the back ?", "Industrial Designer: That  everyone gave that a one or a two . Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .", "Marketing: No .", "Project Manager: The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one  I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip", "Industrial Designer: No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door ,", "Project Manager: no you could  Just like any other one . Okay . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: yeah um like on a normal remote .", "Project Manager: Right .", "Industrial Designer: So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: I think everyone's under three anyway .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: So I think it's  yeah those are the only two points .", "User Interface: Cool . Well  Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff .", "User Interface: We were a bit off task .", "User Interface: Um so uh I can't think of any  So we'll have to like   Mm .", "User Interface: Yeah I dunno . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like ,", "Industrial Designer: It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .", "User Interface: but you could do like  Yeah that's true .", "Project Manager: Yeah . And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah that's true . Mm .", "Industrial Designer: I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Which is why printing might be like  just printing the fruit on   fruit .", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Mm .  Not really  Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation .  Um so project evaluation .", "Marketing: Do you want this and we can all   No .", "Project Manager: I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied  oh , oh it's alright . Uh . Yeah .", "Marketing: It's alright yeah ?", "Project Manager: Um  Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of", "Industrial Designer: Sure .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: I did .", "Project Manager: I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ?", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Sponginess .", "User Interface: The prototype making was very creatively stimulating", "User Interface: and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria  .", "Project Manager: And how was our leadership and teamwork ?", "Industrial Designer: I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .", "Project Manager: Well I thought my leadership was crap personally .", "Industrial Designer: Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters .", "Project Manager: Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? Yeah .  Um .", "User Interface: I think you were fine .", "Project Manager: Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now .", "User Interface: You did a good job leading .", "Project Manager: Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together .", "Marketing: Yeah we didn't  we  uh it all c sort of blended quite well .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like  I don't know , all had ideas about it but", "Project Manager: Yeah . Very democratic . No spats , that was good .", "User Interface: yeah .", "User Interface: No .", "Project Manager: Um and the means for like  the materials we used , how convenient were they ? Like the the pens , the whiteboard ,", "Project Manager: I mean we used", "Industrial Designer: Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff .", "Project Manager: Are you a Mac person ?", "Industrial Designer: No no I never touch Macs either .", "Industrial Designer: I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .", "Project Manager: Huh .", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Marketing: Which isn't very user-friendly though .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .  Well the problem is if you don't  like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . So I have all these documents I can't use now . But yeah I mean I guess it's okay .", "User Interface: I felt like my  I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my  the information that was available to me was kind of just like  or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda  it was kinda like okay , I don't really think  I dunno what I'm doing here .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "User Interface: So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally ,  think it's kinda stupid .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . I never use it .", "User Interface: Yeah but uh", "Project Manager: I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . Like I", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: It didn't really  yeah .", "Project Manager: It", "Industrial Designer: My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works .", "Marketing: I though it was brilliant no ?", "Project Manager: Really ?", "Marketing: No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think .", "Project Manager: I mean m my problem", "Industrial Designer: Yeah it probably does .", "User Interface: So like a f", "Marketing: I think it depends on the role", "Project Manager: yeah , yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah I think so .", "Marketing: no ?", "Project Manager: 'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like  they'd put  send you to sites and stuff right ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing .

And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , that if you introduce a new construction at  at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work .", "Grad F: Mm - hmm .", "Professor E: And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions .", "Grad F: Mm - hmm . Yeah .", "Professor E: And it  to the extent that that 's true then  then it 's a big win over anything that exists .", "Grad D: So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them .", "Grad F: Yeah .", "Professor E: Mm - hmm .

And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come", "User Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: and  so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm .", "Project Manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers", "Industrial Designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah .", "Project Manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,", "Project Manager: no ?", "Industrial Designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will  if we want to have battery , regular battery and and  the solar energy battery it could be  it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,", "Project Manager: So .", "Industrial Designer: but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: so hmm .", "Project Manager: And what tha what about the uh materials ?", "Industrial Designer: And the materials , it depends for example you  if you have a wooden material it can be more  the plastic material is more common", "Project Manager: Impersonal , mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Special for", "Industrial Designer: or you know , you can have some", "Project Manager: Yeah , and i if you  we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .", "Industrial Designer: and it can be interesting .", "Project Manager: Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .", "Industrial Designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .", "Project Manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and  so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .", "Project Manager: And you think that we will be", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: so .", "Project Manager: So wood .", "Project Manager: And what about the buttons ?", "Industrial Designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the LCD you know  lighted buttons because , you know , it's  I don't know  um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion", "Project Manager: No it's fashion , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch TV in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .", "Marketing: What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .", "Industrial Designer: I think a touch screen  will be t as expensive as the LCD buttons so .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: But  And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: So you got email ?", "Project Manager: I dunno .  I think we have only   uh five minutes left .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Participant four ? Functional requirements ?", "Marketing: Uh no , trend watching .  The other one .", "Project Manager: This one ?", "Marketing: Yeah . Uh , I think so , just  Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .", "Marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  I mean  i i it sounds good technically", "User Interface: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: but it's it's not what they want and uh  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .", "Marketing: Now i if we look at fashion in general um  Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,", "Industrial Designer: Ah yes .", "Marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah .", "Marketing: 'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris", "Industrial Designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah .", "Marketing: we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,", "Industrial Designer: Spongy  'Kay .", "Marketing: okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah , yeah .", "Marketing: I dunno .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?", "Marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like um", "Industrial Designer: Pla S", "Marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh", "Industrial Designer: Very stuff  Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .", "Marketing: device , so um", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So ,  as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and  with battery would be something interesting ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Solar .", "Marketing: Yeah , so when I think it's", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: maybe will attract", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm", "Industrial Designer: It will be a", "Project Manager: pro-ecology consumers .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think   Yeah , yeah . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Case .", "User Interface: Later ?", "Project Manager: So you think  case . Something spongy .  Someth no wood .", "Industrial Designer: No wood but  Plastic ?", "Marketing: Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know .", "Industrial Designer: Would some", "User Interface: Pla", "Project Manager: Maybe you", "Industrial Designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . It depends on the design we want ,", "Marketing: Yeah , maybe the base .", "Industrial Designer: so .", "Project Manager: It's it's natural .", "Marketing: But still y", "Project Manager: Th The feeling is natural ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's natural", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and i", "Project Manager: so maybe we can stay with wood .", "Industrial Designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol", "Marketing: Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .", "Industrial Designer: Mm , yeah , it's not right , so .", "Project Manager: But it's still fashion .", "Marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: or", "Project Manager: Yeah ,", "Marketing: I dunno .", "Project Manager: something that you can  into it .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh and what about the user interface concept ?", "Industrial Designer: Google and", "Project Manager: Google and fancy ?", "Industrial Designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ?  And", "Project Manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .", "Industrial Designer: Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested", "User Interface: Uh yes .", "Industrial Designer: and how   It It is an an interesting concept to see  to have uh voice control .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .", "User Interface: The smart controller .", "Industrial Designer: But  and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the TV , so speak directly to the TV and you don't need a remote control actually ,", "Project Manager: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: so .", "Project Manager: but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .", "Industrial Designer: But it will be embedded on the TV and not on the remote control , so .", "Project Manager: That's true .", "Marketing: Yeah  d", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,", "Marketing: I dunno .", "User Interface: Mm .", "Project Manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .", "User Interface: Yeah .

And pf what can we think a supplement to", "Marketing: What interface ?", "Project Manager: Yeah , for the interface something  added value .", "Industrial Designer: I think the supplement can be the voice  .

Yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons", "Industrial Designer: expensive buttons   Yeah , to make some new", "Project Manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .", "Marketing: Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , fruits .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: If possible .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really  it will be seen in the remote control .", "Industrial Designer: Need it to be , okay .", "Project Manager: So you will have  Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: so you will have to model model something .", "User Interface: Okay . Yep", "Project Manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: So ,", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: no more questions , we can close the session .", "Industrial Designer: Sounds good , mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Yeah .

Like  What ?", "Marketing: Why ?", "User Interface: No , I just came in . Uh normally I was one of them .", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: Come on .", "Project Manager: Hello .", "Marketing: Check check check check .", "Project Manager: Oop .", "User Interface: Why won't it wake up ? Is it on ?", "Marketing: The power light doesn't work . You turned it off .", "User Interface: But how ? Ah , there it is .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Uh .", "Industrial Designer: I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . So I'll discuss them with you .", "Project Manager: Okay , we're just going to the  later .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , I received an email as well .", "Project Manager: So we're going to talk about the conceptual model .", "Marketing: Oh .", "Marketing: Hmm .", "User Interface: Which one was mine ?", "Project Manager: So that's me .", "Project Manager: Uh okay . So  Uh okay . Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute .  What's it called , I dunno . Whatever .", "User Interface: The minutes .", "Project Manager: Okay , so we just talked about uh  Oh you want me to show that there or", "User Interface: No ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm no .", "Marketing: Uh", "Project Manager: Okay ,", "User Interface: just tell us .", "Project Manager: we just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um  It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text TV still has to be a possibility . And it has to be easy to learn . That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text TV button . That are the functions . That right ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Yes .", "Project Manager: So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your", "Marketing: Shall I start ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: No . Okay well  I received an email  Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following .  The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh  This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh LCD or uh speech recognition .", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Marketing: But um  this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .", "Project Manager: But we already have the flashing flashing light on the", "Marketing: Uh maybe maybe something new .", "User Interface: Yeah , more .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Marketing: We have to discuss about it s uh  Okay , uh", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Well , I'll I'll get back on it .", "Marketing: features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari  uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Marketing: But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .", "User Interface: Spongy .", "Marketing: But spongy , what what does spongy says ?", "Industrial Designer: Spongy .", "User Interface: Spongy , like sponge .", "Marketing: Spongy . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So rubber , kind of .", "User Interface: Uh soft materials .", "Project Manager: But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be  flexible .", "User Interface: Yeah , but  Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: It's like a sponge .", "User Interface: Soft , sponge .", "Marketing: So it's also a stress-ball .", "Project Manager: That's a good  That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , somewhat like", "User Interface: Yeah , but  Yeah .", "Project Manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the  remote control ?", "User Interface: How are you gonna make it ?", "Project Manager: R_ soft .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,", "Marketing: Uh", "Industrial Designer: I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Okay ?", "Marketing: What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot .", "Marketing: And uh some basic uh colour fronts .  Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .  Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh  Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget .", "User Interface: Yeah , I'll get back on that .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Marketing: So", "Project Manager: It's very uh difficult to to to do it .", "Marketing: Intro", "Project Manager: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Well ,", "Marketing: Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem .", "User Interface: I got f also an email from the the technology department .", "Marketing: So  Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .", "User Interface: They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Well", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: I'll check what they exact mean .", "Marketing: Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .", "User Interface: So uh", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: and it's easy to implement .", "User Interface: th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so  Um but uh", "User Interface: if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement LCD as well .", "Marketing: Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can", "User Interface: Since you have to uh configure speech thing .", "Project Manager: But that's definitely more expensive than", "User Interface: Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .", "Marketing: Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be  .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but a telephone   Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a LCD and and it's about t two hundred Euros .", "User Interface: Yeah , so uh we gotta de", "Project Manager: So uh", "User Interface: We have to decide on that .", "Marketing: Yeah . Okay . That was this ?", "User Interface: Mm uh", "Industrial Designer: Oh I got an email uh  And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And  Um  They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So", "User Interface: L_D_C_ doesn't require", "Industrial Designer: it's m the most expensive . Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip .", "User Interface: Okay . And speech recognition ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , probably too .", "User Interface: Advanced  . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but", "User Interface: I'll I'll give you my design .", "Industrial Designer: Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .", "User Interface: Yeah okay . So we   Well we can  I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um  This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones .", "Project Manager: Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .", "User Interface: More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out  both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: It's the most important part , I think . But  And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .", "Project Manager: Yeah , maybe the teletext tel", "User Interface: Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable ,", "Project Manager: No .", "User Interface: but it's", "Marketing: No , I don't uh  I don't like it .", "User Interface: Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten .  And I think", "Industrial Designer: But it  That's on on the display .", "User Interface: No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So the focus is on these two parts .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So you don't see all the buttons you else need .", "Project Manager: But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .", "User Interface: Uh well um", "Project Manager: So you can't use your thumb for it .", "User Interface: This is how it is now . Um  Here uh  Well we have volume .", "Project Manager: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: I think it is on uh on the bottom too .", "Project Manager: down there . But it's not not the best best .", "User Interface: Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .", "Project Manager: Yeah , why not .", "User Interface: For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more .", "Industrial Designer: Scroll .", "User Interface: By just putting the volume on the side .", "Project Manager: And the channels as well .", "User Interface: And and just channel buttons here .", "Project Manager: Oh yeah .", "User Interface: But I think uh", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , or uh maybe uh  The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .", "User Interface: Well . Yeah , well it's  Basically it's it's here .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's better .", "User Interface: They're on top ?", "Project Manager: Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text TV . Put that on the button bottom .", "Industrial Designer: Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .", "User Interface: You mean uh these to the low ?", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button .", "User Interface: Oh okay . Well , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom .", "User Interface: Mm  Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll", "Industrial Designer: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .", "User Interface: Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to  . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay .", "User Interface: And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh  you don't see 'em very good .", "Industrial Designer: That's that's good , but", "User Interface: I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay .", "User Interface: But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: So we can uh switch these to", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .", "Industrial Designer: No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top .", "User Interface: Okay . Yeah , maybe", "Industrial Designer: But uh we we can switch those two ,", "User Interface: Those two , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: yeah .", "User Interface: And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh  Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right .", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we  I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah , that's cool .", "User Interface: To use", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: No .", "User Interface: So that's something we have to decide on .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , we have to keep it simple .", "Project Manager: We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .", "User Interface: Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not  Nothing square-like .", "Project Manager: Okay , so  Hmm , okay .", "User Interface: Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved  square .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Square . Like .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think .", "User Interface: Okay . So not", "Industrial Designer: So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .", "User Interface: Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of", "Project Manager: Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the  remote control .", "Industrial Designer: looking , I think .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: So the colours also .", "User Interface: Mm   Yeah , it's", "Project Manager: So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .", "User Interface: Black yellow control .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .", "User Interface: Yeah , but uh  I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But", "Project Manager: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .", "Industrial Designer: No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but", "User Interface: Yeah , okay .", "Industrial Designer: We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think .", "User Interface: Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So", "Project Manager: Yeah , it's cool . Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue", "Project Manager: And still trans", "User Interface: Yes .", "Project Manager: Still still transparent .", "User Interface: So", "Industrial Designer: and", "Marketing: Oh yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah . But with all with logo on it .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um   Then the components . The case has just a  Here's black .", "Project Manager: Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ?", "User Interface: Well one of the options .", "Industrial Designer: S", "User Interface: You can  Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: So you can just replace them I think . That was the idea ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , we could do that .", "User Interface: or just uh release one .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box .  Five different", "User Interface: Yeah , uh  Or just uh sell different ones .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Cool .", "Industrial Designer: So you can still th look through it .", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: I uh I dunno .", "Project Manager: It it could be like a Nokia , like  plastic .", "User Interface: A more  Yeah , just uh", "Marketing: Uh uh", "Project Manager: That's better prob", "Industrial Designer: With the hard hard buttons .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: I think uh rubber really has an odd look .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the  uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't  Is  uh a button uh um   How do you say it ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's it's all on one level .", "Marketing: It it didn't it i it don't come out of the  on the background .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , on one level .", "Marketing: It is in uh the c a remote control uh", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I know what you mean . So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: like mobile phones . Like uh the iPod .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Uh just", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's cool .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ?", "User Interface: I dunno what uh kind of material it is .", "Industrial Designer: I think . Or maybe", "User Interface: But", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Just only the basic uh", "User Interface: Oops .", "Project Manager: basic remote control from normal plastic ,", "Project Manager: and", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: the rounds of it from softer s", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And um   Then the L_E_D_ .", "Project Manager: I dunno .", "Industrial Designer: The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s .", "Project Manager: Y", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: Cool .", "Industrial Designer: But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So if you put", "Project Manager: Y i if you  The numbers could be can be", "User Interface: Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: Or it runs the whole", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So", "Project Manager: They can choose .", "User Interface: Yeah , you can halfs transparent ,", "Industrial Designer: Or no", "User Interface: or just that it's comes out a bit .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights", "User Interface: Different , I think , also .", "Industrial Designer: or", "Project Manager: Blue .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ?", "User Interface: Blue or red .", "User Interface: Whatever you want it , I think .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Uh depends on the colour of the", "Project Manager: Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it .", "Marketing: Uh i", "Project Manager: You have to choose", "User Interface: Yeah , that's true . But", "Industrial Designer: No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So", "Project Manager: Is it  Okay .", "Marketing: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: I I know  I dunno . Is", "Marketing: but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ?", "User Interface: Yeah , it can .", "Project Manager: Yeah , okay .", "User Interface: 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well .", "Marketing: You", "Industrial Designer: Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive .", "Project Manager: Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just  No , just some LED .", "User Interface: I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone .", "Industrial Designer: I think it's", "User Interface: And I can change the colour of it .", "Project Manager: Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it  I th I don't think so .", "User Interface: Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So", "Marketing: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Then uh some more technical things .", "Industrial Designer: I don't know what it is , but it should be there  I think .", "Industrial Designer: Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things .", "Project Manager: Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so", "Industrial Designer: W  So we d we just need this and  this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things .", "Industrial Designer: Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .", "User Interface: I'm sure we can fit in .", "Industrial Designer: So I guess we j we just need that .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I don't know what they do or", "User Interface: Yeah okay .", "Marketing: Okay yeah ,", "User Interface: We just", "Marketing: you can you can change  Yeah . No .", "Industrial Designer: Nah , but they just said we need it .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .", "Project Manager: Yeah , a recharger maybe .", "User Interface: Yeah , we have to make sure to uh", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay .", "Project Manager: We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah but", "Project Manager: Is that still the", "User Interface: Yes . Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an  How do you call it ? Accu .", "Project Manager: A recha Oh no . Uh  Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah .", "User Interface: Re recharger . Base station .", "Industrial Designer: Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .", "User Interface: Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Not a separate", "Project Manager: No , just rechargeable batteries .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one .", "Industrial Designer: Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh  Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda .", "Marketing: Ah cool . Okay .", "Project Manager: But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .", "User Interface: So if you hold it , it gets powered .", "Industrial Designer: If you hold it . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and  Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors ,", "Project Manager: It's dark in the room . No .", "Project Manager: It's just batteries ,", "Industrial Designer: so", "Project Manager: that's cheaper  .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .", "User Interface: Mm . So", "Industrial Designer: So we can't use the flat buttons .", "User Interface: we need uh two D_ .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Definitely .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think . Um these kinda materials can be used .", "Project Manager: But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think so too .", "Project Manager: The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , scroll wheels um", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But I think just the volume is enough .", "User Interface: Uh  For channels it's not handy ,", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: because you scroll too fast .", "Industrial Designer: And uh the LCD .

{"meeting_id": "m_test_26", "domain": "committee", "meeting_transcripts": ["The Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the sixth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 pandemic. Today's meeting is taking place by videoconference. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. When you are ready to speak, please activate your mic. When you are not speaking, leave your mic on mute. Of course, change the language when you change the language on the screen.  I would remind hon. members that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel; if you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel; and should you wish to alternate between the two languages, as I just did, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking, each time you switch languages. In addition, please direct your remarks through the chair and speak slowly and clearly at all times to help our interpreters. Finally, for members who will be speaking, we strongly recommend that you use a headset. I recommend the headset for your fellow members, but also for the interpreters as it gets loud, up and down, and it squeaks. It really does make it difficult for them if you do not have the prescribed headsets. We'll go on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we will proceed to presenting petitions, for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. We will now proceed to presenting petitions.", "Ms. Heather McPherson (Edmonton Strathcona, NDP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. World Maternal Mental Health Day took place last week, and today I'd like to take a moment to present a very important petition on behalf of the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative. Whereas perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are the most common obstetrical complication, whereas in Canada and worldwide 20% of women and 10% of men suffer from a perinatal mental illness, resulting in an annual economic cost to Canada of approximately $11 billion, and whereas the U.K., Australia and parts of the U.S. have perinatal mental health strategies and screening guidelines in place and Canada does not, the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative is calling upon the House of Commons in Parliament assembled to create a national perinatal mental health strategy that will provide direction, policy and funding to develop specialized, comprehensive perinatal mental health care services, which include universal screening and timely access to treatment for all women and men during pregnancy and the postpartum period.", "Mr. Scott Reid (LanarkFrontenacKingston, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. My petition relates to cystic fibrosis. If we were in the House now, as May is Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month, one of the days this month we would all be wearing yellow roses in sympathy and solidarity with those who suffer from what is the number one disease killer in Canada of young people. The petitioners have asked us to look at the situation with the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which is scheduled to go through some important and potentially detrimental regulatory changes very soon. They ask that the amendments to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board be rescinded, as these will restrict Canadians from receiving life-saving medications for cystic fibrosis and other illnesses, but in particular, a medicine called Trikafta, which can have the effect of treating cystic fibrosis in the case of 90% of cystic fibrosis sufferers. They ask the government to work with the provinces to find a strategy to jointly allow for the delivery of this life-saving medicine to Canadians across the country and to take a leadership role in negotiating a price for gene modulators throughout all the provinces of Canada.", "Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's an honour to take the mike today, with all colleagues here. It's good to see you all virtually and safe. Petitioners in my community point out in this petition, which, of course, predates the pandemic, that the family doctor shortage is severe in this country. Nearly five million Canadians lack a regular family doctor. This problem is particularly profound in more rural areas, including, as the petitioners reference, the community in which I live, Sydney, British Columbia. We have a very significant crisis and a lack of family doctors. The petitioners call on the government to work with provinces and territories to find a collaborative, holistic solution so that every Canadian has a family doctor and we address the family doctor shortage.", "Mr. Brad Vis (MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, CPC): Good morning, Mr. Chair. I'm presenting a timely petition today that emphasizes the concerns constituents in my riding of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon have with the Liberal government's inherently flawed and undemocratic approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed RCMP-vetted Canadians; to focus taxpayer dollars where they will actually increase public safety, which is on keeping at-risk youth from being involved in gangs and on anti-gang enforcement; and to provide our men and women in uniform at the Canada Border Services Agency with the resources they need to stop the flow of illegal guns into this country. Through this petition, my constituents take issue with how the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal weapons smugglers responsible for the violence in our communities. They note that the use of the phrase military-style assault rifle is purely political posturing, as the term is undefined in Canadian law. They also draw attention to the numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation", "The Chair: I'd like to remind the honourable members that this is a concise prcis of what a petition says, not a speech. I'll let Mr. Vis continue. I'm sure he'll be very brief in wrapping up.", "Mr. Brad Vis: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. That's sufficient.", "The Chair: Okay. Now we'll go to Mr. Johns.", "Mr. Gord Johns (CourtenayAlberni, NDP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's a huge honour to table e-petition 2512, which was signed by 1,198 petitioners, primarily from the province of Nova Scotia. The Province of Nova Scotia invited multinational companies to scope out and develop expansive open-net salmon farming operations. The petitioners cite that the expansion would increase environmental degradation, as seen in similar aquaculture operations in British Columbia, Newfoundland, Norway, Vietnam and elsewhere in the world. It also, they cite, would pose risks to native fish stocks, pollute coastal ecosystems, impair at-risk wild Atlantic salmon, and threaten established fisheries and tourism operations. They also raise concerns that open-net fish farming would not create significant employment and would undermine existing lobster and other fisheries. They are calling on the government to uphold Bill C-68 and species-at-risk legislation, protect our oceans, ban expansion of open-net finfish aquaculture in our oceans, work to phase out any existing open-net fish farming operations currently in place and, lastly, invest in land-based, closed-containment finfish aquaculture. I want to thank these petitioners for fighting for clean oceans, for their local economy and for the well-being of Nova Scotia.", "Mr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. This petition was signed and sent in by constituents of my riding of NanaimoLadysmith. It calls upon the House of Commons to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on Wet'suwet'en territory, ordering the RCMP to dismantle its exclusion zone and stand down, scheduling nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentssomething that has already happened, thankfullyand prioritizing the real implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.", "Ms. Yasmin Ratansi (Don Valley East, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of Don Valley East. The petitioners are asking that the Government of Canada not provide any financial assistance to Canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to COVID-19. They are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to, within or from Canada. The petitioners feel that these Canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund.", "The Chair: We'll now proceed to questioning ministers. The first question will go to Mr. Albas.", "Mr. Dan Albas (Central OkanaganSimilkameenNicola, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Today we've learned that federal workers have been told to ignore obvious signs of fraud when it comes to applying for government benefits. Can the Prime Minister confirm that 200,000 applications have been flagged as potentially fraudulent?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Our priority from the beginning has been to make sure that Canadians get the support they need. We moved very quickly to get the Canada emergency response benefit out, to get the wage subsidy out and to help Canadians in this unprecedented situation. We recognize there will be challenges, and we are going to work through those challenges. Our priority every step of the way was to make sure we helped as many Canadians as possible.", "Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, can the Prime Minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent? This is important.", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Our focus has been on helping as many people as we possible can. Our decision from the very beginning was to get the help out to people and figure out, with retroactive action if necessary, where and when there may have been fraudulent use. Our priority was getting that help out.", "Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, this came from a memo issued by a deputy minister. Did the minister's office or the Prime Minister sign off on this memo?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Again, in this unprecedented situation, our focus has been on helping as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. Other parties might have made a different choice had they been in government, but our focus was getting help to people when they needed it as quickly as possible and cleaning it up afterwards.", "Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, I asked a very simple question. Did the Prime Minister or his minister sign off on this memo that was issued by the deputy minister, yes or no?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we have been focused entirely on getting help to Canadians when they need it, and that has meant that yes, there will be things we will need to clean up after the fact and work to fix, but getting that help into Canadians' pockets during this pandemic was our priority.", "Mr. Dan Albas: I'm asking the Prime Minister to show some accountability. Did he or his office sign off on this memo?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, my office and I have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to Canadians. Perhaps, as Mr. Albas points out, other parties would have been slower to get the money out. We were flowing money to people who needed it.", "Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, the question was quite simple. Obviously the Prime Minister doesn't seem comfortable with the answer. Will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud, or will he write them off, as the story said?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, in this unprecedented situation Canadians have lost their jobs; they've lost their paycheques; they don't know how they're going to be able to support their loved ones and pay for their groceries. We made a decision as a country that we would be there for them and that has been and will continue to be our priority.", "Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister can leave the cottage talk for the cottage. We're asking a very simple question here. Will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud, the fraud will be pursued?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: My commitment as Prime Minister and as a government is to support and protect Canadians. That is what we are doing by giving them the support they need through this unprecedented situation. Perhaps other parties don't think it's important to support Canadians. We will keep focused on supporting Canadians.", "Mr. Dan Albas: That's not what I'm asking here, Mr. Chair. The Conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through. What we are asking about is fraud. All along we've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact, and we expect that to happen. Can the Prime Minister at least confirm that this will happen?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: When we made the determination that we needed to move quickly to help Canadians, we knew there would be a need to clean up after the fact, to go after fraudulent cases. We will do that. Our priority now and in the coming months is to ensure Canadians get the support they need, and our economy comes roaring back. That's what we're focused on.", "The Chair: We'll now continue with Mr.Ste-Marie.", "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie (Joliette, BQ): Mr.Chair, yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the large employer emergency financing facility. That's good. What's even better is that he announced that the loans would be tied to conditions. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent! Unfortunately, I quickly became disillusioned because it is more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Basically, we're talking about fraudsters. There are no conditions that would allow us to tighten the screws on profiteers. Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. Why does the Prime Minister continue to support the profiteers?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. It's a priority of our government. There is no tolerance for tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs. That's why we are introducing measures that support workers, who will continue to be our priority.", "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: Mr.Chair, I'm delighted to hear the Prime Minister say that there's no tolerance for tax avoidance. The problem is that his remarks don't reflect reality. Tax avoidance is the legal use of tax havens. The five big Bay Street banks benefit from this, as do the big multinationals. It's time to tighten the screws on these companies. They have to pay their share. Will the Prime Minister and his government outlaw what is immoral?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, when we announced the large employer emergency funding facility, we recognized that those who wanted to receive tax dollars had to have paid their fair share of taxes. That's why we're putting in place measures to carefully assess the tax structures of these businesses before we loan money to them.", "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: Mr.Chair, sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in Canada and register them in a subsidiary in the Bahamas, Barbados or another tax haven. Does the Prime Minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in Canada?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will assess applications for the large employer emergency funding facility on a case-by-case basis. We don't expect the big banks to need these funds. Before we provide any money, we're going to make sure that whoever wants to access these funds is transparent about how the money is being managed, including internationally.", "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: Mr.Chair, I'll change the subject now. Consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards, which allows contactless payments in shops, not to mention online shopping. This benefits Visa and Mastercard, which charge appallingly high user fees, known as interchange fees. These are almost 10times higher than in Europe and Australia, and it costs our merchants a fortune. Can the Prime Minister follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping interchange fees at0.3%?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are always looking for ways to reduce costs for consumers. We have worked with the big banks and the financial industry to ensure that people who need it have access to the help they need. We're reassessing how we can lower costs for consumers. Right now, we're sending money to consumers across the country who need it to get through this crisis. That's what we'll continue to focus on.", "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie: Mr.Chair, the question doesn't concern consumers, but merchants. A credit card company, such as Visa and Mastercard, that charges a fee of 2.5%to3% per transaction undermines the merchant's profit margin and gets richer at the expense of consumers. I invite the Prime Minister to follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping these fees at0.3%.", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation. Of course, there are some things we can look at over the longer term as well.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Kwan.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Instead of providing a universal direct payment for all, the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind. A single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. She pays taxes on her spousal income, but she is not eligible for CERB. The Minister of Employment said that she is looking into this gap. It has been weeks, and still no action. Will the Prime Minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: I'm happy, Mr. Chair, to correct the honourable member by pointing out that we actually moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit. However, as the member points out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and that's why we've been working diligently to try to fill those gaps. We want to make sure that Canadians who need help, get it.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: While the Minister of Employment has been aware of this for three weeks and says she is looking into it, there's still been no action. The truth of the matter is that single parents and their children who depend on spousal support and child maintenance are not getting support. Will the Prime Minister fix this gap?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: We recognize the particular challenge faced by families, single parents and families with young children, which is why we increased the amount of the Canada child benefit to be able to support people in this particular moment. On top of that, we have looked to fill further gaps that have existed with the Canada emergency response benefit. Well over seven million Canadians have access to CERB, and we will continue to work with them", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: That does not replace spousal support and child maintenance, Prime Minister. Across the country there is no national standard to address the homelessness crisis amidst this pandemic, leaving communities at heightened risk from COVID-19. Canadians who are homeless or living in substandard housing have no access to bathroom facilities for basic hygiene. Those living in crowded SROs and shelters cannot practise social distancing. The problem is particularly acute in my riding in the Downtown Eastside. While the B.C. government has implemented an initiative to house some of the homeless population in empty hotels in the short term, support from the federal government is needed to secure permanent solutions post-COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister commit to providing matching funds and take the right to adequate housing seriously?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: I know that the honourable member wouldn't want to inadvertently mislead the House. The fact is, the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities, including renting new spaces, to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of COVID-19. I recognize there's always more to do, but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy, we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians, and we will continue to do that.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: The Prime Minister must know that the money the federal government sent is deficient. Many people still remain homeless, and they are at risk. Cutting chronic homelessness by 50% over the next decade is not good enough, and that is this Prime Minister's national housing strategy. Will the government stop just making empty promises and ensure that every Canadian has the right to housing? Will he top up the support for provinces to at least match their funds?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, cutting chronic homelessness by 50% is an ambitious goal that no one else has ever been able to do as a government, and we are well on track for it. I would suggest that the member opposite not dismiss that as an empty promise, because we have demonstrated actions on it. I recognize there is more to do. There is always more to do. We will be there and continue to be there for vulnerable people, including homeless Canadians.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: I would remind the Prime Minister that it was the federal Liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993, so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the Liberals. We in Vancouver East have the third-largest urban indigenous population in the country, yet we got less than 2% of the pandemic urban indigenous housing funding. They're overrepresented among the homeless population. Why?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we recognize there is more to do in supporting urban indigenous people. We have moved forward, both through the Minister of Indigenous Services and the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations. We will continue to work with them, recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in Canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government, and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years.", "The Chair: Ms. Bergen.", "Hon. Candice Bergen (PortageLisgar, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, I'm hearing in my riding of PortageLisgar that individuals who are dealing with Service Canada through the mail are experiencing delays. It seems that the mail that's going to Service Canada has not been opened. In fact, one of my constituents sent documents, including a doctor's note, two months ago on March 12 and is now being told that she must resend them because they've never been opened. Can the government tell us whether this is a widespread problem, and how are they dealing with unopened mail at Service Canada?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Ahmed Hussen (Minister of Families, Children and Social Development): Mr. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in Service Canada to meet the expectations of Canadians. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had unprecedented volumes, but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means. We had to close a number of the centres because of COVID-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of Canadians.", "Hon. Candice Bergen: Is the minister aware whether this is a widespread problem? Is this happening rarely, or frequently? I'm hearing about it. I know, from many MPs, we are at the front lines of dealing with and helping constituents who are not only wanting to get support but also are trying to get programs unrelated to COVID-19. Is unopened mail a widespread problem at Service Canada?", "Hon. Ahmed Hussen: Mr. Chair, I'm happy to look into the particular case that the honourable member brings up. I am not aware of unopened mail being a widespread issue. I'm happy to work with the honourable member to see what happened in this individual case.", "Hon. Candice Bergen: Thanks very much. Mr. Chair, the Iver Johnson single-shot rifle is a standard farm gun used by many farmers in my riding, in fact, passed down from generation to generation in some cases. Why are the Liberals making this gun illegal? What's the purpose of banning this particular farm rifle?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I just wish to advise the member that we worked very closely with the Canadian firearms program, with law enforcement and with their firearms verification to identify the makes, models and variants of nine rifles, all of which had in their earliest provenance a design for military use, for soldiers to use in combat. Those are the weapons that have been", "The Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Bergen.", "Hon. Candice Bergen: I would challenge the minister on that. I do not believe that he has been consulting with front-line officers. We're hearing from front-line officers that they are concerned about gangs, drug dealers and illegal weapons being smuggled across the border. They are not concerned with these types of farm rifles that are being used by our farmers and, in some cases, hunters. These are specifically used for hunting. So, Mr. Chair, we'd like to see the evidence on why the Liberals are once again targeting law-abiding Canadians, ignoring gangsters and drug dealers. Why are they banning the Iver Johnson?", "Hon. Bill Blair: It's a great opportunity, I think, when the member opposite says what the police are saying. Let's hear what the police are saying. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles, except for law enforcement and military purposes. The Ontario police leaders said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed rifles. They said, In our view, these weapons have no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by Canada's military and law enforcement.", "The Chair: Ms. Bergen, we have about 50 seconds left.", "Hon. Candice Bergen: Mr. Chair, we've seen this before, where the Liberals introduced a long-gun registry that cost billions of dollars and did absolutely nothing to stop violent crimes. This is a repeat of what the Liberals have done before. Is the minister saying that the Iver Johnson that farmers use is an assault rifle?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Actually, what I'm saying, and what our regulations say very clearly, is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in Canadian society. I would also advise the member that any Canadian killed by gun violence is one too many. We have far too many tragedies where these types of weapons have been used to kill Canadians.", "The Chair: We'll now continue with Mr.Rayes.", "Mr. Alain Rayes (RichmondArthabaska, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. My question is for the Prime Minister. Is it true that Canada Revenue Agency employees who process applications for the Canada emergency response benefit, or CERB, have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected, as was pointed out in a national media report today?", "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue): Mr.Chair, our government considers these to be very difficult times for Canadians. We're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries. I'm very proud of the public servants who work at the Canada Revenue Agency. Nearly sevenmillion", "Mr. Alain Rayes: I repeat my question, which is extremely simple: Is it true that the Canada Revenue Agency sent a memo to its employees asking them to ignore the fraudsters and still send the CERB payments??", "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier: I'll finish my response, which was interrupted: Nearly 7.8million Canadians have applied for the Canada emergency response benefit. The priority is for Canadians to be able to pay for their groceries and their housing.", "Mr. Alain Rayes: Yes or no: Did the Canada Revenue Agency send a memo to its employeeswho are doing an exceptional job, I'd like to point outso that they would ignore the 200,000potential cases of fraud that they detected?", "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier: The answer is no.", "Mr. Alain Rayes: The CERB has been distributed since March25, so for seven weeks now. The federal government website clearly states that if an employee returns to work, the employee must pay back the CERB. Can the Prime Minister tell us whether employees who decide to return to work have to pay back the full $2,000per month, or only $500for week of the month?", "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier: As I mentioned, we believe that Canadians are going through a very difficult time, and we need to support them. We need to help people pay for their groceries and their housing. That's what our government is committed to, and that's what we'll continue to do.", "Mr. Alain Rayes: Mr.Chair, the extremely simple question I am asking the Minister comes from companies and workers. None of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters, even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency. So let me repeat my question; I don't think there can be a simpler one. The answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the Canada emergency wage subsidy. If an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the CERB, must he reimburse $500for each week he works during the month, or the entire $2,000?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion): Mr. Chair, I can clarify that Service Canada will work closely with anybody who transitions either from the CERB to the wage subsidy or from the CERB back to employment to ensure that there's no overpayment, but of course that there's no undue hardship on the individual.", "Mr. Alain Rayes: That announcement was made seven weeks ago. The workers want to know how much they have to reimburse. The companies want to know the situation so that they can make decisions on salary assistance. It seems to me that my question is not complicated: do people have to reimburse $500for each week they work in a month, or the full monthly amount of $2,000?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Mr. Chair, that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker. That's why Service Canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them. I can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation. I recognize that there is some uncertainty, but we're trying to address that. Thank you.", "The Chair: Mr.Rayes, you have 35seconds left.", "Mr. Alain Rayes: The answers that we are getting today are incredible. This is unacceptable, in my view. If an employer complies with the hygiene conditions, can employees still refuse to return to work, and therefore continue to receive the CERB?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Mr. Chair, I can assure all Canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces, we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe. There are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work, and at the end of the day the CERB is there for workers who aren't working due to COVID-19.", "The Chair: We're going to have to go on from here. The next question will come from Mr. Schmale.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale (HaliburtonKawartha LakesBrock, CPC): Thank you, Chair. The Wet'suwet'en elected chiefs and community members have been excluded from negotiations on a memorandum of understanding affecting land rights and titles. Only a few hereditary chiefs have been part of these secret negotiations. The elected chiefs have issued a press release asking for the government to halt the joint announcement scheduled for May 14 on the MOU until the community has had a chance to look at and understand how the MOU will affect them. Will the minister agree with the democratically elected chiefs and the Wet'suwet'en people they represent and delay any announcement until proper consultation can be completed?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett (Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations): I want to reassure the member that communication is ongoing with and between our partners on how to go forward on implementing the Wet'suwet'en rights and title with a Wet'suwet'en-led solution. We encourage the leaders to continue their ongoing, necessary and important conversations with their community on how they want to proceed on a path toward implementing their rights and title. As we work to rebuild Canada's relationship with the Wet'suwet'en, we need to give them space for these important discussions.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale: Minister, is that a yes that the signing will be delayed until the elected chiefs have a chance to look at the agreement?", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett: I believe the elected chiefs have had a look at the agreement. These are very difficult conversations on complex issues around rights and title. This has been outstanding for a long time", "Mr. Jamie Schmale: The current health crisis should not be used as an opportunity to sideline the Wet'suwet'en people and their elected chiefs. The federal government should be bringing the community together rather than actively excluding Wet'suwet'en members. The chiefs are so concerned that they are now calling for the resignation of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations for failure to engage in proper consultations, which has stoked divisions within the community. Will the minister reconsider and put in place a consultation process that honours both their traditional house system and the governance responsibilities of elected chiefs and councils?", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett: Yet again, it's very important the member understand the engagement must take place and be led by the Wet'suwet'en nation. That means the elected chiefs and the hereditary chiefs need to work with all clan members as they determine how they wish to work with Canada and the Province of British Columbia to implement the rights and title of the Wet'suwet'en people.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale: I agree that the Wet'suwet'en should have the opportunity to look at the proposed agreement, but we are still seeing news coming out of the elected chiefs and the people they represent that they have not had a thorough chance to look at this proposed agreement. Will the minister delay the signing?", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett: I think the member will agree that there's a lot more work to do with all the parties. I believe, in terms of the kind of engagement that has taken place in the feast houses and the notification that took place even before COVID-19, that the work is under way and it will have to be Wet'suwet'en-led in terms of what eventually will be their choice as to how they implement their rights and title.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale: Mr. Chair, for two weeks now the Liberals on the indigenous affairs committee have shut down Conservatives and witnesses every time we mention the word Wet'suwet'en. They don't want to talk about the issue, an issue that is very much aggravated by the COVID-19 crisis. The Liberals profess to be the advocates for indigenous communities and the champions of reconciliation. Can the minister tell us why the Liberals are determined to shut down discussion and public debate?", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett: I would have to disagree with the member. I don't believe that there's, at any time, an interest in shutting down discussion or debate. I think, though, that at the COVID committee the issues facing indigenous communities, first nations, Inuit and Mtis around COVID-19 are very important to them. We need to work with them to make sure they can keep their communities safe.", "The Chair: Mr. Schmale, you have 30 seconds.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale: I would argue with the minister and challenge her to talk to her committee members. Each time Conservatives have brought up the topic of the Wet'suwet'en and the situation happening with the elected chiefs and the people they represent, we have been shut down every single time. When will the minister allow the public debate to happen?", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett: Again, in a committee, it is the work of the committee and the decision of the committee. I believe the chair and all members want first nations, Inuit and Mtis to be able to keep their communities safe during COVID-19.", "The Chair: The next question goes to Mrs. Kusie.", "Mrs. Stephanie Kusie (Calgary Midnapore, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. It has been three months since this pandemic started and the Liberals just got around to announcing help for seniors. Seniors are a priority and should be treated as such. Why do the Liberals treat seniors as an afterthought?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors): Thank you very much. There is definitely an interest in and support for our seniors. We've been working to support seniors since the very beginning of this pandemic. I've just had the opportunity to introduce additional measures today wherein we are introducing a one-time special payment for those who receive OAS.", "Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: Nearly two months into living in some form of isolation, watching their retirement savings take a hit and having to take additional health precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, eligible seniors are set to receive a one-time payment of up to $500. Why does this government consistently undervalue seniors compared with everyone else?", "Hon. Deb Schulte: I just want to make sure that my honourable colleague remembers that we have already given a GST top-up of almost $375 for single seniors and over $500 for couples. This is in addition to what we've just done today where, as you said, it's $500.", "Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: According to Abacus Data, 69% of Canadians feel that there will be a second wave in the pandemic, and 52% of Canadians believe that there is a shortage of medical equipment, including personal protective equipment. Given these surprising figures, what is the government's plan to bring in enough personal protective equipment, should there be a second wave of the pandemic?", "Hon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement): Our government is aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies that Canada needs, from a diverse range of suppliers around the world and here at home. We're working directly with businesses across the country to rapidly scale up domestic production capacity to meet current and future needs. At this point, our primary focus is on front-line health care professionals, but we are also exploring federal government assistance in areas of essential services so that PPE exists where workers need it. We are following public health guidance on this issue in looking to see where we can best assist.", "Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: According to Public Services and Procurement Canada, despite 1.8 billion units of PPE being procured, less than 6% of N95 respirator orders have been filled, less than 8% of surgical mask orders have been filled, and just 1.4% of face shield orders have been filled. We know that orders are not deliveries, so what's the delay?", "Hon. Anita Anand: Let me start by saying that we are working in an incredibly difficult and competitive global environment and are procuring millions of items: face shields, gowns, hand sanitizer, and N95 surgical masks, and ventilators every single day. There is a delay in the production of these goods, but we have had many deliveries coming into Canada, including over two million face shields", "The Chair: We'll have to go back to Mrs. Kusie.", "Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: A national security expert from the University of Ottawa has said that the national emergency strategic stockpile has failed in the current crisis, resulting in some provinces such as Saskatchewan using expired PPE, and provinces such as Alberta using faulty PPE that cause rashes and headaches. What is the government doing to expedite procurement and to counter the risk of faulty PPE, given that 34 of the suppliers are from China, which has already supplied significant faulty PPE?", "Hon. Anita Anand: I will start by saying that we have multiple supply chains operating at the same time, from China, and domestically, and from the United States and other countries around the world. Our first priority is to make sure that we get safe, effective equipment and supplies into the hands of our front-line health care workers. Given the global supply chains and their competitive nature, this is an ongoing project and we are having success for our front-line health care workers.", "The Chair: We'll now go on to the next question from Mr. d'Entremont.", "Mr. Chris d'Entremont (West Nova, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Ten weeks ago the Minister of Fisheries, in responding to my question in question period, acknowledged that the lobster fishery was being negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and was facing losses of up to 95% of its Asian markets. Mr. Chair, on April 28 I asked the minister what she was doing to support harvesters who were left out of the $62.5 million aid package. She mentioned that she was looking at sector-specific areas to make sure that the issues were addressed. Can the minister tell us what the government's plan is to directly support seafood harvesters?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Bernadette Jordan (Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thank my colleague for that very good question. We know that the fish and seafood sector has been extremely adversely affected because of COVID-19. We've started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB is available for seasonal workers as well as people who have run out of their fishery EI, but we know that more needs to be done. The fishery enterprises are uniquely structured, which is why we're looking at measures to address the concerns they have. I'm working with my provincial colleagues, as well as my caucus colleagues.", "Mr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr. Chair, most fishermen are not eligible for the wage subsidy program due to the stipulation that it cannot be used for employees who are related to their employer. Most fishing enterprises, like farm enterprises, are family oriented. Many fishermen have their wives, their sons, their uncles or their fathers working for them, and sometimes it's the whole family on the boat. Can the minister explain what the government's plan is to support fishermen who do not fit into any actual program and who desperately need direct financial help from the federal government to survive?", "Hon. Bernadette Jordan: Mr. Chair, we know that, because of the unique structure of fishing enterprises, they are not eligible for many of the supports we have put in place. We have made changes to the CERB to make sure that people who run out of the fishers EI are eligible as well as seasonable workers. We know that more needs to be done for the harvesters directly. We are working on direct supports. We have put in place measures to address processors' concerns so that harvesters continue to have a place to sell their product. We know that more has to be done. I am working with my cabinet colleagues to find solutions, and I hope I will have more to say about that very soon.", "Mr. Chris d'Entremont: In recent weeks, lobster fishermen in the gulf region of the Maritimes were shocked to read an additional subsection of regulations that was added to their fishing conditions for the 2021 fishing season. This addition was for a catch limitation or quota to which none of the harvesters or advisory members were privy. This created quite a chill within the lobster fishery, for sure. Can the minister tell us how these detailed regulations managed to get added without her authorization, and can licence-holders expect to see these same regulations in their conditions when their season gets going in the future?", "Hon. Bernadette Jordan: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the people who brought to my attention the conditions that were put on licences in the gulf. Those were not done under my authorization. They were removed right away from the condition of licence, and they will not happen.", "Mr. Chris d'Entremont: My next question is for the Minister of Health. Mr. Chair, on Wednesday, February 26, after the death of 23-year-old Chantelle Lindsay from Nova Scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis, I asked the Prime Minister whether the government was going to make Trikafta, which might have saved Chantelle's life, available to Canadians. Now that almost 12 weeks have passed, we understand that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to Health Canada for study. Many of my Conservative colleagues and I have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with Vertex. Can the Minister of Health tell us when this drug will be available to CF patients in Canada?", "The Chair: Honourable minister, the floor is yours.", "Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. My heart goes out to the family of Chantelle, who are obviously suffering an unbearable loss. I agree with the member that we want to make sure that effective drugs are available in Canada. As the member has pointed out, Vertex has not applied to sell Trikafta in Canada. However, there is the special access program that makes drugs like Trikafta available. In fact, the majority of people who have applied through the special access program to get access to the drug have received access. I would encourage the member to continue his correspondence with the manufacturer, as will we.", "The Chair: Mr. d'Entremont, you have 36 seconds.", "Mr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr.Chair, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals are having to deal with considerable losses of income. In my constituency, tens of thousands of tourists use the ferry between Bar Harbor, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. What is the government planning to do to help the ferry to survive and to resume service next season, if the borders remain closed this summer?", "Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages): I have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague Mr.d'Entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country, and particularly in the Atlantic region. In light of the new funding for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, I will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector.", "The Chair: Mr.Savard-Tremblay, the floor is now yours.", "Mr. Simon-Pierre Savard-Tremblay (Saint-HyacintheBagot, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Despite all the upheaval it causes, the crisis we are experiencing, considerable in scope though it is, can also be an opportunity to begin a transition. What is essential in normal times may, during a crisis, become crucial. What is unjust may, in times of crisis, become frankly scandalous. In Quebec, we are generally allergic to blatant injustice and inequality. Yesterday, Ottawa announced new support for large companies. Many of us in Quebec feel that, when a company knocks on the state's door to ask for assistance, it is totally legitimate for the state to impose conditions before providing its support. We in the Bloc Qubcois feel that there should be a limit, a ceiling, on the assistance provided to large companies, in order to avoid abuses in executive compensation. That is also the prevalent position in Quebec. A few years ago, after the Bombardier affair in QuebecI will not dwell on that because Quebecers are all too familiar with itthree of the four political parties that sat in the National Assembly and that still sit these took a position of that kind. A number of civil society groups in Quebec share it also. The United States, which, you will agree, is no bastion of socialism, has already implemented similar policies for periods of crisis. The idea is to offer support, but with conditions. According to a report published by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives on January2, the 100highest-paid CEOs in Canada earned 227times more in 2018 than the average worker. The average salary for workers increased by 2.6% between 2017 and 2018. Given that inflation was then at 2.3%, it can be said that there was practically no increase. By contrast, the salary increase for CEOs in the same period was 18%, even in cases where the companies suffered losses. Let us be clear that we were not in a crisis when that study was conducted. We cannot even imagine what the figures are today. At this point, we are no longer talking about a gap but an abyss. Wealth is concentrated at the top of the pyramid, but clearly does not flow down to the base. Does the government intend to put a ceiling on executive compensation to ensure that they are not the only ones to profits from the support at this time of crisis? The question is clear and I am asking you to give me a clear answer. If I don't get one, I am going to have to demand a new version of the Clarity Act.", "The Chair: The honourable Minister has the floor. I would also like to remind members to ask their questions through the Chair", "Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance): Thank you, Mr.Chair. We know that our approach has to help small and medium-size companies, but also large companies in order to provide a bridge to the end of the crisis. In our opinion, that is very important. It will protect the jobs of Canadians and the future of our economy. That's why the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility is very important. That said, we know that it is necessary and important to impose conditions. Yes, we do want to make sure that the facility is available for companies that are going to continue to support our economy, to protect their employees, and to make a significant contribution to our communities. That is why we have attached a number of major conditions to our approach. We will have more details on the subject in the coming days. We established from the outset that we had to impose conditions on executive compensation. That is very important. We are going to consider the rules and conditions that are needed in order for the facility to be available to the companies, the operations and the employees. Of course, conditions are required to ensure that the facility is available for operations, not for dividends or share buybacks, for example. We will impose conditions of that kind. We also want to make sure that we are aware of the situation the companies are in. For example, we want to be sure that they are not engaged in tax evasion.", "The Chair: We'll now go on to Ms. Sgro.", "Hon. Judy A. Sgro (Humber RiverBlack Creek, Lib.): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I appreciate the opportunity. I will be sharing my time with the member for KingsHants. Canadian seniors are worried about COVID-19. In my own riding of Humber RiverBlack Creek, 30% of the population are 65 or older. We know they are one of the highest risk populations. During this time, their costs have gone up. They have had to spend extra on medication and grocery delivery, as many cannot leave their homes. I have also heard of many seniors who are facing extra dispensing fees. These costs all add up, and many seniors were already carefully budgeting before the pandemic. It is so important that our government be there to support them. Can the minister please tell us what our government is doing to ensure that vulnerable seniors get the support they need during this very difficult time?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Deb Schulte: My colleague is right. Seniors have faced increased costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our government today has responded to that with additional action. We announced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for seniors eligible for GIS. This means there will be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time. Beyond this, we announced $20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that will help seniorsfor example, to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected. We've worked tirelessly on this as well as on other recent measures like the GST credit to help the most vulnerable seniors. Thank you to my colleague for her advocacy.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)): You have 30 seconds left, Ms. Sgro. Go ahead with a short question and a response.", "Hon. Judy A. Sgro: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I want to applaud the minister for that work. I know she's been working extremely hard to make sure that we get some additional announcements over and above all of the ones we have already made, so congratulations. Keep up the work. You know there is lots more we want to do.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Please give a short response. Go ahead.", "Hon. Deb Schulte: Thank you very much to my honourable colleague for her advocacy. Thanks for everyone's advocacy. Seniors across the country have been communicating with us and letting us know their needs, and we have been responding.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now I'll go over to Mr. Blois. Go ahead.", "Mr. Kody Blois (KingsHants, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's always a privilege to have a chance to speak on issues that matter to Canadians, whether it's from the floor of the House of Commons or, indeed, from my house here in Nova Scotia. It's great to see everyone across the country. Like my colleagues, I'd like to thank the staff of the House of Commons for their continued work to make sure that we have this forum to be able to continue the democratic process. I would also quickly like to thank my staff both here locally in KingsHants and in Ottawa for their continued work for my constituents. Mr. Chair, my question through you is to the minister of agriculture. In KingsHants, agriculture is an important economic driver for our economy. We have the greatest concentration of agriculture producers east of Montreal. From our beef industry to our wine industry and everything in-between, it is extremely important. We have the Kentville Research and Development Centre and the Hants County agricultural exhibition, the longest-standing exhibition in North America. We know that COVID-19 has had impacts on the agriculture industry to differing degrees. In particular, KingsHants is home to an important dairy sector. We also have a growing and important horticulture sector. Can the minister specifically provide an update to the House on the measures our government has taken on those two particular commodity groups that are so important in my riding?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister.", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Thank you, Mr. Chair. We are targeting support to some of the most critical challenges facing the food supply chain. Last Tuesday I was proud to announce our emergency processing fund for a total of $77.5 million, $50 million for the surplus food program and $125 million through AgriRecovery to support our beef and pork producers. Concerning the dairy sector in particular, I'm hopeful that tomorrow we will get the support of all of the parties to be able to respond to their request for an increase in their loan capacity from $300 million to $500 million. I would like to encourage all farmers to apply to the business risk management programs, including AgriStability, for which we have improved some of the mechanisms.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go on with questions, but I'll also just ask Mr. Blois to excuse me for mispronouncing his name. Let's go now to Mr. Masse for Windsor West. Go ahead, Mr. Masse.", "Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP): During the COVID-19 pandemic, the State of Michigan has become an epicentre of the outbreak. The city of Detroit alone has more deaths than the entire province of Ontario. The border communities of Sarnia and Windsor have higher per capita infection rates than the rest of the province. Next week, the border restrictions between the U.S. and Canada expire. With the premiers of B.C., Quebec and Ontario opposing the opening of the border at this time, will the restrictions be extended, or is the Prime Minister discussing changing the restrictions?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister.", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs): Let me assure the honourable member that, first and foremost, all decisions about Canada's border are taken by Canadians and with the health and safety of Canadians first and foremost in mind. When it comes to the current agreement's coming up next week, we are in very close conversations with Americans about next steps.", "Mr. Brian Masse: What changes are on the table?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Let me just be clear that I didn't speak about any changes; I spoke about a very collaborative conversation with our American neighbours about next steps.", "Mr. Brian Masse: Are you discussing any changes to the current status right now?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: I found during the NAFTA negotiations that negotiations are best not conducted in public, but let me just assure Canadians that the health and safety of Canadians is first and foremost. Our government is taking a cautious approach, and we're working effectively.", "Mr. Brian Masse: This is not negotiation. This is whether there are changes on the table. What are they?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Let me just say that I think the honourable member was actually seeking to know what exactly is being discussed with our American partners. Let me just say that we are taking a very cautious approach to the health and safety of Canadians. A very collaborative discussion is happening.", "Mr. Brian Masse: Will more information be shared between your government and the American government on Canadians and Americans crossing the border on both sides?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: I'm not sure what the member is alluding to, but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well. Non-essential travel is down very sharply. Essential travel, particularly for trade, continues, and that's a good thing, too.", "Mr. Brian Masse: With border communities having more rates of infection, will they receive additional PPE and financial assistance to deal with the loosening of current border restrictions that is being discussed?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Let me just emphasize to the honourable member that on a couple of occasions he has implied that a loosening of the current restrictions is being discussed. Let me be very clear that this is his assertion; I have not said that.", "Mr. Brian Masse: Apparently, we're meeting for nothing. I'll move to the large commercial banks who are profiteering off or squeezing Canadians during this public crisis. Credit card interest rates are still high from previous price-gouging levels. Despite numerous favours from the Liberals, there have not been significant changes. Vancity Savings Credit Union demonstrated leadership when it set credit card rates at zero. Will the government use its statutory powers and force the banks to offer the credit card relief that Vancity has already done?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister.", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to say that we recognize the challenges that Canadians face, especially with issues like credit card rates. That's exactly why we've been working on this issue since we came into office. We came to an agreement on interchange fees that was important for consumers. Most recently, during the COVID-19 crisis, we've negotiated with the banks and encouraged them, and they have come out with reductions in their credit card fees that are significant, and deferrals for customers", "Mr. Brian Masse: Will you use your statutory powers, yes or no, to do what Vancity has done to help Canadian consumers?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: As I've said, Mr. Chair, we're continuing to support consumers. We're continuing to work together with banks to make sure that they are giving the kind of support necessary to their customers, and we've seen actions in this regard, supporting customers.", "Mr. Brian Masse: Why do banks have to profit at higher interest rates on Canadian consumer and retailer exchange rates during COVID-19?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think it's important to clarify that banks have come forward and given deferrals to customers in trouble and cut their interest by half  Mr. Brian Masse: Not on credit cards.  Hon. Bill Morneau: and that's been important on credit cards.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): There's time for one more short question. Go ahead, Mr. Masse.", "Mr. Brian Masse: Will the minister use his powers if the banks continue to charge Canadian consumers interest rates that are higher than Vancity's?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, again, we will continue to work with banks to ensure that they're supporting their customers. What banks have done on credit cards by cutting their fees in half is an important nod in that direction.", "Mr. Bruce Stanton: Next, we have Jacques Gourde.", "Mr. Jacques Gourde (LvisLotbinire, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Quebec is Canada's biggest producer of hydroelectricity, a renewable energy that is the pride of the Quebec nation. The only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of Quebec, in Ontario, for instance. This competitively priced power could help us reduce our environmental footprint and further cut greenhouse gas emissions. Will the government show leadership and allow Canada's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor, as we proposed?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we are continuing to work towards that end. It is always very important to protect Canadians, and we are going to stick to that approach.", "Mr. Jacques Gourde: Mr.Chair, Canada's dairy processors have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis and the new CanadaU.S.Mexico Agreement, or CUSMA. Some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10% to 50%, depending on the processed product. Will the government commit to granting import permits under CUSMA to Canada's dairy processors, not retailers directly?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr.Chair, I can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation. I should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new NAFTA. That is important to Canada and Quebec, and I'm very pleased that we were able to do that.", "Mr. Jacques Gourde: Mr.Chair, the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand. Canada's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers, while contributing $19billion to GDP. Now those very processors are being asked to try to export Canadian value-added products. Will the minister commit to giving Canada's dairy processors import permits, instead of encouraging American multinationals?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for his question. I fully understand, as we all do, the important role processors play in our system and our country. I can assure the members of the House that we will continue to work with Canadian processors as the agreement comes into force.", "Mr. Jacques Gourde: Mr.Chair, when it comes to the COVID-19 crisis, what Canadians will remember is that those with access to reliable high-speed Internet will have fared better, feeling less financial strain, than those who are cut off from the rest of the world. Is the government ready to invest in making high-speed Internet available to all Canadians, no matter where they live in the country?", "Hon. Maryam Monsef: Yes, we are, Mr. Chair.", "Mr. Jacques Gourde: Mr.Chair, the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of Canada's tourism industry. The pain will be felt by thousands of Canadians, who will have to find new jobs in order to survive. Is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens?", "Hon. Mlanie Joly: Yes.", "Mr. Bruce Stanton: Ms. Joly, you have to switch to the French channel and turn on your microphone.", "Hon. Mlanie Joly: Yes, I look forward to working with my fellow member on this issue. I know the tourism sector is important to him and, especially, his constituents. Let's work together to find ways to get this hard-hit sector moving again. Many people have lost their jobs and need assistance from the government. That is why we're here, providing a helping hand at this difficult time so they can come out the other side.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Continuing with questions, we'll go to the honourable member for SaskatoonUniversity, Mr. Tochor.", "Mr. Corey Tochor (SaskatoonUniversity, CPC): Good afternoon, everybody. With respect to entering Canada, does the government consider spousal reunification as essential travel, yes or no?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister.", "Hon. Bill Blair: The CBSA has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-Canadian citizen, who has no status in Canada, attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential. They are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel.", "Mr. Corey Tochor: Respectfully to the minister, you're letting down Canadians. People are being stranded, and you need to do better as a government.  Changing gears a little, all Canadians would agree, or can agree, that the Prime Minister requires suitable accommodation. Why did the government simply not tell Canadians that the Harrington cottage needed to be rebuilt and massively expanded?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I would ask the honourable members to direct their questions through the chair. The honourable minister.", "Hon. Anita Anand: The NCC is an independent Crown corporation. It recognizes the importance of the official residences it has jurisdiction over. The work at Harrington Lake is part of a broader program to preserve and maintain and restore all official residences under NCC management, and we will support the NCC in its important work.", "Mr. Corey Tochor: Was there something in particular that this government did not want Canadians to know about the cottage, or is secrecy all this government knows how to do?", "Hon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, this information was and has been public since 2018. There is no effort to hide any information from the public in this regard.", "Mr. Corey Tochor: Respectfully, Canadians feel misled on this, and we're not clear on what the expenses were, how large an expansion it was", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Go ahead, the honourable government House leader.", "Hon. Pablo Rodriguez: On a point of order, Mr. Chair, I believe this has absolutely nothing to do with the pandemic, so the questions are out of order, in my opinion. Thank you.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I thank the honourable government House leader for his comment. Certainly the scope of the special committee on the COVID-19 pandemic does expect and anticipate that the subject matter will be related to the matter at hand, so I would ask honourable members to continue to keep within those bounds. Of course, members will also know that we're unable to gauge that until members have spoken, so I would ask members to keep on subject. Let's go back to Mr. Tochor to finish his question, and we have about two minutes remaining in this spot.", "Mr. Corey Tochor: Yes, thank you, Chair. The point I was making was about transparency or lack of transparency that is hurting our efforts with COVID-19. Changing gears onto CERB, who came up with the number for CERB? Why is it $2,000? A senior gets $1,200, people with disabilities get $1,600, and now we've added another ad hoc program on top of those. I'd like to know a little more about how and who came up with those unique numbers.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister.", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Working collaboratively between ESDC and the Department of Finance, we determined that that would be an appropriate amount, based on what workers were earning and what we anticipated they would need to live on, and what we anticipated they would be losing by way of employment income.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Your last question, Mr. Tochor.", "Mr. Corey Tochor: I have a really quick question, which I've heard in my office, on charities and non-profits that do not have their own payroll number and are ineligible for the wage subsidy. Does the Prime Minister have a program fix coming so that charities and non-profits can receive the wage subsidy?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister.", "Hon. Ahmed Hussen: Mr. Chair, we understand the important role that charities and non-profits are playing to help vulnerable Canadians at this difficult time. We have announced supports in the amount of $350 million to ensure that not only do they continue that great work, but also expand it to serve the most vulnerable to get through the COVID-19 pandemic.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Okay. We will move to the next questioner, Mr. Aboultaif from Edmonton Manning. Mr. Aboultaif, go ahead with your question.", "Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, last week markets were shocked when leaks regarding the state of our economy came to light before the market even opened. This caused worry to investors at home and abroad about the integrity of our markets and the nature of the leak, which is, in itself, unprecedented. Section 34 of the Statistics Act indicates the following:     Every person who, after taking the oath set out in subsection 6, is guity of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or to impreisonment for a term not exceeing five years or both:       wilfully discloses or divulges directly or indirectly to any person not entitled under this Act to receive the same any information obtained by him in the course of his employment that might exert an influence on or affect the market value of any stocks, bonds or other security or any product or article, or       uses any information described in paragraph for the purpose of speculating in any stocks, bonds or other security or any product or article   My question for the minister is this: Does the government consider this case to be subject to paragraph 34 or 34 and a criminal offence, yes or no?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister.", "Hon. Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry): Mr. Chair, my hon. colleague is absolutely right that the current situation with regard to the COVID crisis is deeply problematic, and we want to make sure that any information we share with the Canadian public with regard to economic measures or labour market numbers follows the appropriate process. The breach that occurred is completely unacceptable. Our government has denounced this breach. That breach was not the way to deal with such sensitive information. The member has alluded to several paragraphs within the Statistics Act. I can assure him that we are looking into this matter and that Statistics Canada is looking into this issue as well. Going forward, we will ensure that such a breach does not occur again, because it's important that we continue to have the confidence of Canadians during this current health care crisis.", "Mr. Ziad Aboultaif: Okay, I will take that as a yes. So this matter should be investigated, yes or no?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: As I have indicated very clearly, what has happened is completely unacceptable. This breach should not have occurred. This matter is being looked into, and we want to assure Canadians going forward that", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Back to Mr. Aboultaif.", "Mr. Ziad Aboultaif: In that case, the minister said the matter will be looked into. Basically, my understanding of this case is that Statistics Canada is going to investigate itself, or does the minister think that the government should refer this to the RCMP?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Sorry, could you repeat that question? I had a bit of an issue and could not hear the question.", "Mr. Ziad Aboultaif: Will Statistics Canada investigate itself or will the government refer this to the RCMP?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, there are appropriate protocols in place to look into such breaches. Those protocols will be followed, and the appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such breaches do not occur going forward.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Aboultaif, you have about a minute left. Go ahead.", "Mr. Ziad Aboultaif: The minister indicated that this will be investigated, but during the investigation into the SNC-Lavalin scandal, the Liberal staff refused to co-operate. Will the minister commit today that all Liberal staff will co-operate with this investigation?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Again, we've been clear that it's important that any such breach be taken seriously. What has happened is unacceptable, and we will ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to make sure that such breaches do not occur going forward.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have time for one short question, Mr. Aboultaif. Go ahead.", "Mr. Ziad Aboultaif: There's no doubt about the general terms, but I need to make sure that the government will commit that its staff will co-operate. Yes or no?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: The process is very clear. The protocols are very clear. The law is very clear, and we will make sure that the process is followed and the law is upheld.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll continue. The next question will go to Mr. Yurdiga.", "Mr. David Yurdiga (Fort McMurrayCold Lake, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Before I start my questions, I would like to thank the various ministers, parliamentary secretaries and the Speaker of the House for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in Fort McMurray. Your support during these trying times is much appreciated. The oil and gas industry is under severe strain. Over the past number of years, we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down. The federal Liberal government's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill, Bill C-69, which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada; and the oil shipping ban, Bill C-48, for the northern coast of British Columbia, which also had a negative effect on the oil industry. These two bills alone pushed over $200 billion of investment out of Canada, causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels. To compound Alberta's economic problems, we have an international oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a huge drop in demand for oil. Mr. Chair, 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies, there are still no applications open for these loans. Can the honourable Minister of Natural Resources tell us when the Liberals will act on their promise?", "Hon. Seamus O'Regan (Minister of Natural Resources): Mr. Chair, I'm happy that we were able to announce today some liquidity measures for large cap corporations in the oil and gas sector. These measures will provide them with the liquidity that they needed, and this is also the liquidity that they asked for. It was on April 17 that we started liquidity measures for small and medium-sized businesses in the oil and gas industry, and those are the ones in which 85% of workers are affected. Today's measures will complete that. I'm very happy that we've had such people as the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers come out and say that this is what they asked for and this is what they need, and we have produced what they need in order to ensure the future competitiveness of Canada's oil and gas sector.", "Mr. David Yurdiga: Mr. Chair, we have seen junior oil companies close their doors. The larger companies have sent contractors home and laid off employees. Many of these contractors are indigenous companies, and they are having a difficult time qualifying for programs to save their businesses. Can the honourable Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations inform us of the measures the government is taking to ensure there are no gaps in the current programs, and commit to review the eligibility criteria for owners of aboriginal businesses struggling to qualify for financial help?", "Hon. Seamus O'Regan: Mr. Chair, Canada's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people, including 11,000 indigenous people, in every part of Canada. It is essential that we support those businesses. It is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan. We have provided supports for those businesses, and we will continue to do so, also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds.", "Mr. David Yurdiga: Mr. Chair, western Canada oil storage is under extreme pressure. If thermal projects such as SAGD are shut down, those facilities could be lost forever. If the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production, what is the government's plan to ensure Canada's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production?", "Hon. Seamus O'Regan: Mr. Chair, we have worked with industry and with provinces on every front to ensure the stability of the oil and gas sector of our country. We have concentrated on workers. We need the workers in our oil and gas sector in order to lower emissions and achieve a greener economy. We need their determination and their ingenuity. We need to make sure that their jobs are held whole. Therefore, we are looking after workers and we are looking out for companies that hold onto those jobs for those workers.", "Mr. David Yurdiga: Mr. Chair, the government's assistance package for the Canadian oil and gas industry provides some hope to the industry. The lack of detail and action has led to some challenges. Can the minister clarify? On a medium-sized energy company's eligibility, if the company is in default to financial institutions, does it still qualify for the business credit availability program?", "Hon. Seamus O'Regan: Mr. Chair, we know that our oil and gas sector is suffering through two crises. We have the impacts of COVID and the effects of a global price war, and we have been tackling both of these on each front. On April 17, we announced liquidity measures to support the small and medium-sized players. That made up 85% of the jobs in this sector. We have announced liquidity will be further made available to larger players. As well, through the BCAP, we are making sure that more companies are eligible so that they can remain whole and so they can hold onto the jobs that we need.", "The Chair: The next question will go to Ms. May.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, colleagues. It's lovely to see all of you. My first question is directed to the Prime Minister. It's a higher-level abstraction. As we all know, we're being told we need a vaccine, and the quest for a vaccine is all-consuming globally. However, people who think about this issue and the question of the power structure and profit motive, particularly Dr. Matthew Herder of the Health Law Institute at Dalhousie University, are questioning this model. We know that Jonas Salk never sought a patent on his polio vaccine. Can we ensure that public dollars for finding a vaccine will result in a product that is shared globally, openly, and is not for profit?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the member for her question. Our approach has been very clear when it comes to science. We have an open science model, and we're working with different partners and different jurisdictions to help develop vaccines and look at countermeasures and other therapeutics. Our goal is to make sure that we do so in a collaborative fashion, because this is a global pandemic, but make no mistake: If it's Canadian ingenuity and Canadian IP that's driving it, we want to support them as well.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: As a follow-up to the minister's comment, I note it was interesting to see the claim made by this public health institute at Dalhousie about the wonderful research that was being done in Winnipeg on an Ebola vaccine. Because of the for-profit motive and the interests that big pharma had in seeing their market before they developed the product, it is alleged that the Ebola vaccine was actually delayed by the for-profit model. I wonder if we might consider examining this profit motive around the development of life-saving vaccines and other drugs. Is that a conversation the minister is having with others?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: I'd like to thank the member for her question. I'm working very closely with Minister Hajdu and the chief science advisor to look at all options. I'm glad the member highlighted the Ebola virus vaccine, which was developed here in Canada. I'm proud of the fact that the DNA sequencing for SARS was also done in Canada. We have incredible scientists and researchers. We are engaging with them and empowering them, and we will continue to share details of this with the public.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: Changing gears, we know that the new regulations limiting what are described as military-style assault rifles and guns have been very controversial. It's very clear to me as an opposition member why we haven't seen legislation on any fast track. It's obviously not the sort of legislation that would gain unanimous consent. Wouldn't it be wise to table for first reading the entire legislative framework so that we know what we're talking about in the long term with regard to the buyback program and other aspects of this issue?", "Hon. Bill Blair: I want to thank the member for the question. I want to assure her that at the first opportunity, we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in Canada, including legislation to deal with a buyback program, which we've indicated we will put in place. There are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation. We understand that it's a priority. The pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep Canadians safe, and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: I confess that I was disappointed by this morning's announcement on support for seniors. I had been hoping for much more, because I hear from many seniors. I'm going to focus my question for the minister on the issue of seniors homes. Some that are being run by not-for-profit societies are actually running very well, certainly in my community, but they are facing increased costs that could bankrupt them. As yet, there's no program to help a well-run seniors home that is not experiencing a loss of revenue and has lots of staff working hard. These homes have increased costs for wages and increased costs for PPE and nowhere to look for help. Is there help coming?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: I offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe. The member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes, but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things, including costs. We continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through, for example, generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate. We continue to have conversations at the health ministers' table on how we can support them.", "The Chair: I'm afraid we're out of time on that one. The next question will go to Mr. Davies.", "Mr. Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway, NDP): Mr. Chair, Canadians are appalled by the disgraceful treatment of seniors in care homes across this country. Old folks are being left in soiled clothing and are going without baths for weeks. They are packed four to a room in dangerously unhealthy conditions. The situation is so bad that the armed forces had to be called in to intervene. To the Minister of Health, is her government prepared to take strong action to address this crisis in seniors health care?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the member has illustrated some of the horror stories that have appalled us all as Canadians and certainly as parliamentarians. We know that seniors deserve to live in dignity and safety with the utmost care, and that just hasn't been happening in this time of COVID and certainly, in some cases, in previous times as well. As the member knows, I've said publicly that I believe we need to hold long-term care homes to stronger standards. I have begun those preliminary conversations with my counterparts. I am working with many ministers across our government to think about how we do that, how we", "The Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Davies.", "Mr. Don Davies: Mr. Chair, if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country, social services would seize them. Over 80% of the deaths in Canada from COVID-19 have occurred in long-term care homes. Canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries, including France, Germany, Denmark and Ireland. Canadians want action. What specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the member opposite knows that long-term care homes have rested largely in the jurisdiction of provincial governments and, in fact, municipal governments, which often run them and fund them partially as well. That's why it's important that we have those conversations with our provincial and territorial partners, but the member can rest assured that it is on the top of my priority list to engage with my colleagues all across the country, including many experts who have studied this issue multiple times, to come up with stronger standards so all seniors have quality of life, safety and dignity in their elder years.", "Mr. Don Davies: Mr. Chair, Canadians don't want politicians pointing fingers at each other; they want our seniors taken care of. COVID-19 didn't cause the problems; it exposed them. Decades of neglect by governments at all levels have resulted in this calamity. Not a single province or territory in Canada is meeting the minimum standards of hands-on care for seniors, and death rates from COVID-19 in private, for-profit facilities are two to three times that of public or non-profit homes. Will the minister agree with New Democrats that we need strong national standards, federal funding tied to enforcement and public delivery of care to effectively improve care for seniors?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, certainly the member of Parliament has made an assertion that there is finger pointing. I don't think that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, what I hear from my colleagues at the provincial and territorial level is the willingness to collaborate on how, first of all, we get through this crisis together and strengthen safety for seniors in homes right now and then how we look to the future to build a stronger network of long-term care or care alternatives that will ensure that seniors have the right and the ability to live with dignity and safety in their homes.", "Mr. Don Davies: Mr. Chair, what I'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take, but let me move to another subject. Like long-term care, COVID-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system. Millions of Canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs, revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status. Will this government finally move to ensure all Canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, as you know, in the mandate that the Prime Minister gave to me, working on a national pharmacare plan is still there. I know it feels like a lifetime ago, but the member has very aptly illustrated why affordable medication is so important as part of a robust health care system. I look forward to continuing our work on ensuring that all Canadians can afford the medication they need.", "The Chair: It is now over to Mr.Simard.", "Mr. Mario Simard (Jonquire, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. A few weeks ago, the Prime Minister made a big announcement expressing his desire to launch an economic recovery plan that fast-tracks the transition to a green economy. MinisterGuilbeault, MinisterMcKenna and MinisterWilkinson were appointed to a group tasked with doing just that. Today, I worry that the group is nothing but an empty shell, a convenient post-crisis political pitch. On the natural resources front, the government's two main announcements primarily involve fossil fuels. We need only think of the $1.7billion being invested to clean up orphan wells. Perhaps there is an environmental component, but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around yesterday's announcement by Export and Development Canada. It's going to lend TC Energy $500million to build its Coastal GasLink pipeline. That's $500million for a pipeline project that will eventually produce 8.6million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually. How does the government reconcile that with its desire to transition to a green economy?", "The Chair: The honourable minister has the floor.", "Hon. Jonathan Wilkinson (North Vancouver, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much for the question. Certainly at this time, Canadians are most particularly focused on ensuring that support is provided so that they can put food on the table and pay their rent. We are starting to focus on the relaxation measures in many provinces and territories in Canada. That is the primary focus of the government, as it is of Canadians. Certainly as we move forward, we need to be thinking about the kind of society and economy that we want to create for the future. In that context, we need to learn lessons coming out of this experience, and certainly we need to ensure that we are addressing challenges that are on the horizon, including the challenge of climate change. Those are conversations that will need to be had as we move beyond this phase of the crisis, but at the current time, the focus is clearly on combatting the virus.", "The Chair: Ms.Pauz has a point of order.", "Ms. Monique Pauz (Repentigny, BQ): There was absolutely no interpretation while the minister was speaking.", "The Chair: Since so many are having issues with the interpretation, let's take a quick break while I try to fix the problem on my end. I'm going to ask the minister to repeat his answer, and we'll see whether the interpretation comes through this time. If not, please let me know, Ms.Pauz and anyone else who doesn't hear it.", "Hon. Jonathan Wilkinson: Of course, the issues of the future are very important. That means not just climate change, but also other challenges that we saw during the coronavirus crisis, challenges we need to take into account. Now, I think Canadians want us to take the time to focus on what is currently going on. We have put rules in place to protect Canadians. We really need to think about this. We need a plan. Of course, we need to think about the future, but I want Canadians", "The Chair: Mr.Simard has the floor.", "Mr. Mario Simard: Thank you, Mr.Chair. I want to tell you that, of all industries, the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry. Unfortunately, in Canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries, including providing liquidity support. Yesterday's announcement suggests that the $500million being provided by EDC is for a single project: Coastal GasLink. In 2017, under the softwood lumber action plan, EDC's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $500million. Now, EDC is shelling out $500million for just one project, Coastal GasLink, even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $500million when it needed EDC's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs. The industry accounts for 58,000jobs in Quebec and $6billion of Quebec's GDP. As I see it, there is a fundamental inequity. My question is for the natural resources minister. Does he think this situation is fair? Will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector?", "Hon. Seamus O'Regan: Mr.Chair, since 2017, our government has invested billions of dollars.  I'll answer the question in English.  Sorry. We launched our softwood lumber action plan to support workers in communities. We introduced funding through the strategic innovation fund specifically for forestry. Building on our work today, we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates, diversifies and grows. Over these past two and a half months, I have spent an inordinate amount of time with CEOs, with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast. A few days ago, I convened a meeting of CEOs from all parts of this country, from Quebec to British Columbia, to talk to them about solutions, about answers. The liquidity measures that were announced yesterday will help some of them. We will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the COVID crisis, so we make sure that", "The Chair: The next question will go to Mr. Dalton.", "Mr. Marc Dalton (Pitt MeadowsMaple Ridge, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm hearing from small business owners like Joel, who runs a fitness club here in Pitt MeadowsMaple Ridge, and is very concerned that their landlords refuse to participate in the rent assistance program. These businesses have seen revenue drops between 50% and 100% and are asking for just 25% off their rent. When will the government help small businesses whose landlords refuse to be team players during this pandemic?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, first of all, we share the member's concern that small businesses be supported. That's why we've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance. With respect to rent support, we are encouraging landlords to support this measure. Obviously, rent and landlord-tenant relations are under provincial jurisdiction. At every opportunity I talk to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there. We will continue to support small businesses. We believe this program has significant merit. It allows for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75% of the rent. We think it is an excellent program. It will require the provinces to step forward and enforce it.", "Mr. Marc Dalton: Mr. Chair, here in B.C., businesses are preparing for phased reopening. A number of my constituents, including Kathy, who owns a beauty salon, are concerned about meeting the PPE requirements. What is the federal government doing to ensure businesses in my riding can get access to the PPE they need to keep their employees and customers safe when they reopen?", "Hon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as a federal government, we are aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies. Our first priority is to provide PPE to our front-line health care workers. However, we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with PPE.", "Mr. Marc Dalton: Mr. Chair, Craig and Matt are co-owners of Wanstalls, a firearms retail outlet in downtown Maple Ridge that employs eight people and serves thousands of law-abiding firearm owners in my riding, people who are now made to feel like criminals by the Liberal government. Further, they are now stuck with tens of thousands of dollars of inventory that they can no longer sell. What are they supposed to do to keep open in this already tumultuous COVID environment?", "Hon. Bill Blair: It's important to understand that none of the restrictions that we have put in place, the new prohibitions, in any way impact weapons that are used for the lawful purposes in Canada of hunting and sport shooting, so those weapons remain available to Canadians engaged in those lawful activities. We have prohibited weapons that were not intended for the legal purposes of hunting and sport shooting and for which firearms are available to Canadians. What we prohibited were weapons designed for another purpose, an unacceptable purpose.", "Mr. Marc Dalton: Mr. Chair, according to the CERB website, if a recipient earns over $1,000 in a reporting period, their entire $2,000 benefit must be repaid. I have constituents who are working part time and casually. They're worried that if they take an extra shift, they will lose their CERB, but if they refuse a shift, they will also lose their CERB. It's a classic Liberal catch-22. A worker may unknowingly make over the $1,000 by a couple of dollars. Does the government intend to make them repay all their CERB if they barely go over the threshold?", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Mr. Chair, that is why we're working with individual eligible CERB recipients to make sure they are not put in positions of undue hardship. At the beginning, the registration restricted it to basically not working, and then we relaxed the condition to earning up to $1,000. I can assure the member that we will work with individuals. Service Canada is reaching out to people so that nobody is in the difficult position he is talking about.", "Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ): I have a point of order, Mr.Chair.", "The Chair: There's a point of order.", "Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe: There were some technical issues earlier during my fellow member Mario Simard's turn. Normally, each person gets five minutes. According to our calculations, he had about 45seconds left. This is a serious point of order. We shouldn't get the short end of the stick because we speak French in the House. Thank you, Mr.Chair.", "The Chair: All right. We'll check what happened, but I had stopped the clock.", "Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe: I assure you he lost some time.", "The Chair: The minister had to repeat his answer. We'll check and make sure it doesn't happen again. The good thing is that this is all being filmed, so we can watch the video back to see what happened.", "Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe: Mr.Chair, because the ministers chose to answer in French owing to a technical issue, their answers were unduly drawn out, which cost my fellow member speaking time. I think he should be given a chance to ask one last question, to be fair. Otherwise, French speakers are going to be at a major disadvantage.", "The Chair: As I said, I'll check what happened and we'll have a solution for next time.", "Hon. Steven Guilbeault: I have a point of order, Mr.Chair.", "The Chair: We have another point of order. Mr.Guilbeault now has the floor.", "Hon. Steven Guilbeault: I hope the member isn't suggesting that, because some members of the House are making an effort to speak French, they are unduly dragging out the time, as he seems to have said. Good for them, I say, for trying to speak a language they aren't necessarily comfortable in for the benefit of other members.", "The Chair: I think a debate is brewing, but I'm sure that's not what people want, so I don't want an argument to break out over the fact that different languages are being spoken. We'll look into what happened and fix the problem so it doesn't happen again. We will go back to Mr. Dalton. You have about 30 seconds for a question. Thank you. Mr.Chair, many farmers in my riding and elsewhere are afraid they won't have enough workers this summer and fall. What is the government going to do to make sure those receiving the CERB and CESB have the right information and know about the job opportunities in the agri-food sector in our communities?", "The Chair: The honourable minister has 15seconds to answer.", "Hon. Carla Qualtrough: Mr. Chair, I can assure the member that while we are supporting Canadians through both the CERB and the CESB, we are creating tens of thousands of jobs, including in the agriculture sector, to make sure there is labour available in this important and essential sector.", "The Chair: Those are all the questions we will have for today. I want to thank everyone. When I first got elected as Speaker, one of the things I mentioned was that you would want everyone who was watching, including your families and your friends, to be proud of you. I can honestly say that they would all be very proud of what we went through today. I am very proud of today's session. I want to thank everyone for wearing the headsets. I didn't see anybody answer without one, and it is very much appreciated, not only by our fellow members but also by the people who are translating into the other language that you are not speaking.

Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that  well it wasn't really my area because  I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one  .", "Industrial Designer: Um and uh  I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm . Could I  can I interject to ask a question there ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah sure .", "Marketing: is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the  surrounding it ?", "Industrial Designer: Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .", "Marketing: Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah the the", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: They are .", "Industrial Designer: well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption", "Marketing: Oh I see .", "Industrial Designer: and how much you need to send the data across .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .  Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the  w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the TV unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh  just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .", "Industrial Designer: It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the  uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would  the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the TV receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to  whatever um whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using and since that that's another use and  reason to use that infrared because that's what all TVs use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the  it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of  d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa  thing that you could have ,", "Marketing: Mm . Mm .", "Industrial Designer: I  th that was just sort of a general point there .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: And that's uh  yeah .", "Marketing: That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .", "Industrial Designer: Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there ,", "Project Manager: Okay , thank you very much .", "Industrial Designer: so if you wanna", "Project Manager: Um , would you like to continue on from that ?", "User Interface: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Ooh .", "User Interface: 'Kay . It can be", "Project Manager: Or , maybe move the laptop over .", "User Interface: okay , that's okay with me .  further .", "User Interface: Oops . Why's it not working ? F_ eight , right ?", "Project Manager: F_ function .", "Industrial Designer: Function F_ eight yeah .", "User Interface: Okay . Mm why's it in the right ?", "Marketing: No . The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No .", "User Interface: Yeah , it's connecting  .", "Industrial Designer: No , no yeah it's just  .", "Marketing: Meter adjusting .", "User Interface: okay .", "Project Manager: Oh , there  .", "User Interface: Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's  it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering  maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will  this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you  you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like  it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh  added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not  of no use of punching in the uh  trying to put in those things in  on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in  add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's  so this is  if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use  usage and all that .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .", "Marketing: Mm .", "User Interface: Uh any comments like , if you want ?", "Project Manager: 'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end ,", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um", "Industrial Designer: Yeah sure .", "Marketing: 'Kay .", "Project Manager: Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . Oh , God . Right , okay .", "User Interface: I think you'll have to", "Marketing: Have I got to keep this here ?", "User Interface: You can't", "Marketing: Does it matter ?", "User Interface: It'll have to  this can't be pulled .", "Marketing: I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ?", "Project Manager: We just do the best we can .", "Marketing: Uh , whoops .", "User Interface: You'll have to push it a bit more .", "Marketing: Will it manage ? Bit more ,", "User Interface: Yep .", "Marketing: oh dear .", "User Interface: Yeah this is more than enough . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: There we go , I've got a bit more of the cable  .", "Marketing: Oh .", "Industrial Designer: There we go .", "Marketing: Is that okay ?", "User Interface: Yeah I think you can pull it out now .", "Marketing: Thank you ,", "Marketing: just pull it closer a little bit .", "Industrial Designer: Uh you should be able to  and", "Project Manager: Yeah , you might .", "Industrial Designer: yeah , there you go .", "Marketing: Get it right over , okay , thank you .", "Project Manager: Ah . Look at that .", "Marketing: Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .  Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .  Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there .  Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take  said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh  when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this .  I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,", "User Interface: 'Kay .", "Marketing: but I think I'll just keep it simple ,", "Marketing: if there's any more information I can email you extra details ,", "User Interface: That's fine .", "Project Manager: Okay . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: is that okay ?", "Project Manager: Right , um", "Industrial Designer: Huh .", "Project Manager: we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext ,", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um  our control is only going to be for TV , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that   it limits the cost for us ,", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?", "Project Manager: It says for TV only , so  looks like it's just", "Marketing: Just channel-hopping .", "Project Manager: yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but  I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for TV only . But I mean , general TV controls do do video as well .", "Marketing: Would that imply video use ?", "Industrial Designer: T yeah yeah . I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g", "Project Manager: I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined TV and videos don't you ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . If yeah", "Marketing: Mm-hmm , yes .", "Industrial Designer: and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the TV anyway so on to on to like the TV hard drive or so .", "Project Manager: Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and  programming .", "User Interface: Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?", "Marketing: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons ,", "User Interface: Ten perc", "Project Manager: Mm .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Pens", "Industrial Designer: and they're not that great anyway .", "Marketing: In fact I've just called up that table there ,", "Industrial Designer: Alright , okay .", "Marketing: we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate .

Right now they 're in the process of being edited . Um , the , um  Let 's see , I hired two transcribers today .

We had a good core", "PhD G: Well , they won't hear this since they 're going . They won't be transcribing this meeting .", "Postdoc A: Yeah , but still . I mean , I d it 's just a matter of we  w we 're  we 've got , uh ,", "Professor F: No backs .", "Postdoc A: two of the ones who  who , um , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a  a lot of hours , which is wonderful , and excellent work . And so , then , in addition , um , I hired two more today and I 'm planning to h hire a third one with this  within this coming week , but   but the plan is  just as , uh , Morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the  on the leaner side , you know , rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now ,", "Professor F: Mm - hmm .", "Postdoc A: because if the IBM thing comes through really quickly , then , um , we wouldn't wanna have to , uh , you know , lay people off and stuff .

An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event  and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way  in the unlikely event that we actually find  that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because , you know , there 's , you know ,  all the stuff that  that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're  and they 're faster  the  the pipeline is faster than   uh , than the generation , um , eh , i in  in the day  e event that that day actually dawns , uh , I  I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do .", "Postdoc A: Oh , yes .", "Professor F: So I  I think  that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we  if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later .

Um , so we 're starting to see some patterns and we 're hoping that maybe with ,  I don't know , double or triple the data  with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results . But we did find that some of the features that , I gue Jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the  distance of , um ,  boundaries from peaks in the utterance and  some  local , um , range  pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers , which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words .

And a neat thing there too is I tried some   putting the speaker  So , I gave everybody  a short version of their name . So the real names are in there , which we couldn't use .

It 'd also be interesting to look at the EDU meetings because we did include meeting type as a feature , so whether you were in a r Meeting Recorder meeting or a Robustness meeting did matter  to  interrupts because there are just fewer interrupts in the Robustness meetings .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "PhD G: And so the classifier learns more about Morgan than it does about sort of the average person ,", "Professor F: Mm - hmm .", "PhD G: which is  not bad .

So , um , in PLP", "PhD G: There was a  like a hum or some or  when they recorded it ?", "Professor F: No . It 's just , it  it 's  it 's not at all uncommon for  for recorded electronics to have different , um , DC offsets .", "PhD G: Or just  ? Huh .", "Professor F: It 's  it 's , you know , no big deal . It 's  you know , you could have ten , twenty , maybe thirty millivolts , whatever , and it 's consistently in there . The thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency , so that it 's irrelevant . Uh , but with P L P , we didn't actually have that . We had  we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a  a , uh , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency ,", "PhD G: Hmm .", "Professor F: like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does . We had something more fancy . It was later on it didn't have that . So at that point I reali \" oh sh we better have a  have a high - pass filter \" just , you know   just take care of the problem . So I put in a high - pass filter at , uh , I think ninety  ninety hertz or so  uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate . And I never put anything in to adjust it for different  different sampling rates . And so  well , so , you know , the code doesn't know anything about that and so this is all at eight kilohertz and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at   instead of at ninety .", "PhD C: Hmm .", "Professor F: So , um , I don't know if Dan fixed it or  or , uh , what he", "PhD C: Well , he made it a parameter .", "Professor F: He made it a parameter . So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it and then  and then it 's taking care of sampling rate , which is great .", "PhD D: What  what is the parameter ?", "Professor F: He had a", "PhD D: Is it , uh , just the f lower cut - off that you want ?", "PhD C: It 's called , uh ,  H - HPF .", "Professor F: H  Yeah . Does HPF on  on his feat feature .", "PhD C: u And  but HPF , you know , when you put a number after it , uses that as the hertz value of the cut - off .", "PhD D: Mm - hmm . Oh , OK .", "Professor F: Yeah .", "PhD C: So .", "Professor F: I mean , frankly , we never did that with the RASTA filter either ,", "PhD C: Mm - hmm .", "Professor F: so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing , which is  another old  old bug of mine .", "PhD C: Mm - hmm .", "Professor F: But , um  Um . So that  that was the problem there was th we  we  we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz", "PhD C: Mm - hmm .", "Professor F: and it just wasn't doing it , so now it is . So ,  that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of a percent . It  still wasn't a big deal .", "PhD C: OK .

Cuz we need to do the exact experiment .", "PhD C: Right .", "Professor F: I mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative . So . Um . Now the thing is , in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much and  and part of what I view as the real power of it is that it  gives you a transformational capability  for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do , not just th the standard front - end , but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth ,", "PhD C: Mm - hmm .", "Professor F: and allows you to feed them to the other system with this  through this funnel .

Yes .", "PhD D: so we treated the th first thirteen as though they were  standard features .", "Professor F: Yes .

So in fact you  the  the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system .

You can prove that it 's  it 's a , uh  If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh  by training up on local  local , uh  local frames .

Uh , either way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot . And  But if you had a  a really big training set , a recognizer , uh , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set  I thought that  One thing with the HTK is that is has the  as we 're using  the configuration we 're using is w s is  being bound by the terms of Aurora , we have all those parameters just set as they are . So even if we had a hundred times as much data , we wouldn't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many Gaussians or anything .

That was  generally   how helpful that was .", "Project Manager: Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're  Right , um  So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what  where you've come from our last time .

Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .", "Project Manager: And why not wood ?", "Industrial Designer: And ,", "Project Manager: And why not wood ?", "Industrial Designer: hmm ?  Uh , well we can use wood .  I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive .

Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel .

It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find  come up with a solution that's better than mine .

Um the minutes from the last time . Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um we have decided on a  leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost ,", "Project Manager: things like that ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range .", "User Interface: 'Kay .", "Project Manager: Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ?", "Marketing: Shall I ?", "User Interface: Yep .", "Project Manager: Yes if you feel", "Marketing: Okay . We just connect up .", "Marketing: Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um  the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional  uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,", "Project Manager: It's okay  .", "Marketing: sorry Project Manager  . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .  Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan .

Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the  Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .

Or", "Industrial Designer: You  Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get  when when you got TV .", "Project Manager: That doesn't count though does it ?", "Marketing: Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?", "Project Manager: I thought it was U_V_ like", "Industrial Designer: No .", "Marketing: Artificial light ?", "Industrial Designer: Is it ?

Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .", "Project Manager: Okay", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Uh", "Industrial Designer: Uh is that uh  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ?

So  we'll probably have to implement that .", "Project Manager: Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?", "Industrial Designer: Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago ,", "Industrial Designer: but I've seem to forget them   forgot them . Um  oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?

Well , maybe I um  but it it can be quite simple ,", "Industrial Designer: I I don't know .", "User Interface: you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay .", "User Interface: The uh the the digits in black .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: well , it can be for design , of course .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product .

Very good point . Yeah .", "User Interface: Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now .

Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or", "User Interface: But um  Necessary , yeah .", "Project Manager: yeah . I dunno , it's uh   that's more Sebastian's uh um", "User Interface: Yeah .
