Currently, there are a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. In that regard, it could be argued that children have fewer rights than adults."

At one end, it was relatively white and the other end was relatively black, but in the middle there were shades of grey. Towards one end of the spectrum, they might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. That would be very much towards the serious end. And the absolute other end of this spectrum was one where they decided it's an offence that they think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court."

Therefore, they had to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school, but recognising that it was a progression."

Also, for them as well they had reinvigorated their managed move provision and they were currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school was doing because, sometimes, it worked in the past, but what they were seeing now was that it was not quite working now, and it was understanding why."
