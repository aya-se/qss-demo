In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 \u00b5g in 100 ml of breath. Across the border in Scotland, it drops to 22 \u00b5g. In terms of the practical application of the legislation in Wales, it would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences was likely to be very small and they would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that came through would go to people who had got a close network and could talk with each other."},

Some of them were fairly obvious, such as previous convictions. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. But there was no part of the law that said that prosecution would always follow.

Offences that the police referred to us for a charging decision would generally be offences where they felt that there should be a prosecution rather than an out of court disposal.

So, raising awareness was important, and he saw, and was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which was now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something which was potentially divisive."},

So, the fact that they might not have many prosecutions was not a reason not to say that they shouldn't signify that certain behaviour was or was not acceptable. The criminal law provided a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and the Ministry of Justice had taken action to deal with that.

What would make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and what would have a bigger impact on children who were in danger of being left behind, were the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. First of all, the teachers were absolutely crucial to this. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they were going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what they wanted to do was provide reassurance that they were devising an accountability regime for our system that was in line with the aims and objectives of the new curriculum and put them in the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems.
