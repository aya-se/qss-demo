There was a spectrum of offending. At one end, it was relatively white and the other end was relatively black, but in the middle there were multiple shades of grey.

In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, his approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that they issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, they would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences would be very small and they would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that came through would go to people who had got a close network and would talk with each other."},

Barry Hughes answered that it was extremely unlikely.
