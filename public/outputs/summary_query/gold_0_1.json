There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and the Ministry of Justice had taken action to deal with that, and they had had a number of people who were now in a position to act as intermediaries.

When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. They had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of English and Wales, and they make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why the numbers are likely be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest."},

The criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand.

Also, it's a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms for staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the year.
