One of the advantages of the new curriculum was to take the pedagogical principles that underpinned their approach to early years education actually further into children's educational journey, rather than the false divide that they had at the moment. They also had to consider, though, that for some children they may be out of school for reasons, and telling them that they've got to do a full curriculum may be hugely detrimental to their mental health and well-being. Therefore, any changes to qualifications should be a gateway to further study in FE, whichever type of route the child took."},
