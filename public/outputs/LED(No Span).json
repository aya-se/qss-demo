They would use rubber as a padding or for the grip, and they would incorporate the image of the company into the design. There would be a G-U-I interface in the middle of the remote control, which would be like a touch screen. The remote control would be made of plastic and rubber, and it would have a spongy feel. It would be in vegetable and fruit colours, and the team would take inspiration from the vibrant colours of fruit. The team would use a combination of rubber and plastic for the case, and rubber as the material for the rubber cover. The battery would be double A and triple A, and there would be no rechargeable batteries. The group would have to decide on the position of the buttons."

Also, the rubberised covers were going to be relatively cheap to produce and they would be available in a year's time."
