Second, there were other offences in Wales that did not exist in England, but they didn't crop up very often. In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales, Barry Hughes thought they would need to update the guidance, and it would go back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. Then they would build themselves up to come up with the appropriate guidance according to the circumstances."},

Barry Hughes answered that there were some, but the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England was possibly more significant for the general public. In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, Barry Hughes thought they would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which were set out, in his view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that they were discussing here."},
	{"relevant_span": [], "query": "What were the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that?", "summary": "Barry Hughes gave two examples. One was that the removal of the defense would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raised issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it was fairly evident that there was a defence available in England that was not available in Wales. In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, Barry Hughes suggested that they would work with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that they issue nationally suited both England and Wales."},

The basic responsibility of the prosecution was to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt. There would be no change whatsoever to the burden of proof nor to the standard of proof."},

They were likely to be very limited. The number of criminal prosecutions nationally would be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where they had to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. There would not be many more prosecutions, but there would be fewer than there were presently, because there was a greater degree of protection for children. And, in my experience, the police were much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target."},

	{"relevant_span": [], "query": "What are the implications of the legislation on prosecutions and potential alternatives?", "summary": "Barry Hughes gave two examples to illustrate the way in which things could be different. First, there was a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and it was fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that was not available in Wales. Secondly, the criminal law provided a general framework within which to operate, which most people tended to understand. Therefore, the fact that they might not have many prosecutions was not a reason not to say that they shouldn't signify that certain behavior was or was not acceptable."},

The remote would need an energy source to power the remote, an input which would be buttons, a processor to take the information and transmit it to the television, and also a sender for location signal.

Project Manager thought that it would be cool to have it all on one, because users could turn it on then turn up the volume, and then go to the menu, so they don't have to switch.

The most important buttons were those to do with channel selection, teletext, volume, and power, and the other ones were the settings, which were used less than zero point eight to zero point five times per hour. Also, the team agreed to have a button for all the settings and then from there go on to the audio on the screen, either on the remote or on the television, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that."},

The ontology and discourse nodes could be combined to create a weighted combination. The discussion then turned to how to deal with the intermediate nodes."},

He thought that people who know about places and places to go and so on would store this information and it would probably be more reliable if it came from the context of the user, rather than from the user model. He also thought that it was important not to have loops because things don't converge if there are loops."},

The team also agreed that they should have an intermediate node for each decision, which would be a measure of the match between the object's feature and the user's feature."},
	{"relevant_span": [], "query": "What were the opinions of the participants on the intermediate node?", "summary": "The professor suggested that they could move the endpoint to an intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go-there S node sort of fed into the endpoint.

A lot of these children would have things like attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and they made up the cohort of pupils who were excluded.

Also, the prevalence of ASD\u2014autism spectrum disorder\u2014and trying to get the learners the right provision was sometimes a challenge. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister had currently made some more money available, if we look at experiences that have happened in England, in particular, because there are direct parallels with legislation, we know from those experiences that ALN funding had become increasingly under pressure, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals, because they were losing them time and time again."},

It should be user-friendly and usable by all age groups. The remote control could have a flip top remote control so that when it is flipped over the top, it can have a bigger screen in the flip over. It could also have an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books."},

It was only for TV, it was not going to be a combined control. It would be for TV only, which limits all the different things that it could do and makes it easier to understand for the consumer. There would be no buttons, a flip-open design, reduced size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming, things like that.

It could be accessed by a wide range of audience and it could punch in new features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people. It was easier to lose and it was not daunting to the older generations. Besides, it was cheaper in the long run."},

The first was that the model was cheating by having the hand-segmentations as the basis of the recognition. The second was that it was getting too many beeps. The team thought that they could fix this by adding a high-pass filter to the model and changing the insertion penalty. The professor pointed out that this was a good idea, but it would require more data."},

They would also need to custom design a circuit board, because the circuit board had to take the button input and send it to the output so they had to design that each time. The group also discussed the material options of rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. The rubber case was recommended against titanium because it could only be used in the flat cases and it was really heavy."},

Industrial Designer thought that they needed a screen with music because people would need to scroll to get to a specific song. Project Manager thought they would need a screen for the wheel because it just seemed like in order to have someone going around and using the wheel, it would be necessary to have the screen.

In addition, there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them. Also, infrared might be an issue because lots of devices already use infrared, so they would probably have to implement that.
