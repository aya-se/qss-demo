    "summary": "Barry Hughes thought that the law should reflect contemporary society and the law was evolutionary in nature, and should be changed to reflect the way in which people behaved within society. In terms of reasonable chastisement, there was a spectrum of offending. The first stage was whether there was sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. If there was not enough evidence, the police did not go on to consider whether it was in the public interest, and the second stage was when the evidential stage was satisfied."

Barry Hughes answered that there was already a certain degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognised this. In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, their approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that they issue nationally suits both England and Welsh. They would build themselves up to come up with the appropriate guidance according to the circumstances, and they would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that came through would go to people who had got a close network and could talk with each other."

Barry Hughes replied that they had no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decided not to investigate, they had to disprove that to the criminal standard, which was beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the CPS had a network of contacts built up here that was adequate for the purpose, and they could liaise with Kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they developed."

Barry Hughes answered that there would be minor financial consequences for the public prosecution service in the period between now and the bill becoming law, but there would not be any significant financial consequences in that time. The reason was that they would keep a manual log of every referral, which would be unmanageable if they were dealing with hundreds and hundreds of cases. Moreover, the numbers would be very small, which meant they would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, they would wish to keep the situation under review, and they would look back to see how they were doing."

Some of them were fairly obvious, such as previous convictions. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it was more likely they were going to be prosecuted the next time. However, there was no part of the law that said that prosecution would always follow. So, there would not be many more prosecutions, but there would be fewer than there were presently, because there was a greater degree of protection for children."

Barry Hughes answered that there was a clear spectrum of offending that a child could realistically consent to and then it got to offending that could not be consented to. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law was more unclear as to what you can consent to. The law would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child felt about it. In circumstances where both parents were the suspects, they probably wouldn't be asking them."

There would also be cases, and they saw these not that rarely, where the police would bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and the CPS would take a different view on the Public interest stage. Therefore, if a person from England was being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that applied in Wales. However, the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it was that the Act, if passed, would achieve its intentions."

The criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand."

The professor explained that there was a flaw in the way they were using the model, which was that the model was trained on a specific task and not on the whole language. The team discussed how they could improve the model by adding more features to the model and changing the recursion. They decided that the best way to solve this problem was to increase the number of outputs of the neural networks."

I know what this is about', and it all made sense at that point. So, to try and, sort of, discourage it at a younger age may be doing them a disservice in the long run."

They were also looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out their approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas. In terms of some of the things that people were asking them to look again at, some of that was around some the language used. So, they would make a statutory provision for the 'what matters' statements."

The 'what matters' were the articulation of the big ideas. They were always intended to represent, as a whole, the learning that every learner should get. So, the idea was to make sure that those were consistent, and then that still left huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those, which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them."

There was also a need to modernise RE; some people perceived the current curriculum as a bit old-fashioned. And there were concerns about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum. Therefore, the key messages were focused on whether children should be taught RSE at all and whether they should have access to the entirety of the curriculum. And also there was much feedback on making sure that the profession was ready to deliver a renewed, modernised RE curriculum."

The primary purpose for assessment was for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, which was why they referred to a formative and summative assessment. However, some of the trouble that they had got ourselves in previously was because there had not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability, and, when they started using assessment for accountability purposes, that's when, potentially, that assessment process got corrupted and they had gaming."

Project Manager suggested that they should focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later. Industrial Designer pointed out that people between age group of twenty to thirty-five are the biggest market, but Project Manager argued that they were focusing on a sort of mid-range, business kind of class type people, so they should not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities. The group also discussed how to combat repetitive strain injury, which was caused by repetitive small movements. The project manager suggested that a touch screen could be a better option."
