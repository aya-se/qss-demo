In respect of children in particular, the Children Act 2004 did make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment. By way of contrast, it was not available for an offence involving an adult."

There would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute.

However, he did not see a need to update or amend the guidance because it went back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage.

They had other members of my staff who were involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and they believed that that involvement would ensure that they were sufficiently interconnected.

There was a long list of matters that they took into account. Some of them were fairly obvious, such as previous convictions. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. However, there was no part of the law that said that prosecution would always follow. So, they would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child felt about it."

The numbers, again, would be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where they had to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses.

So, the fact that they might not have many prosecutions is, for him, not a reason not to signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. The criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand."

Actually, it's probably larger than an A-level by now. And the investment they had to put into WorldSkills was huge. So, for some of their learners, they choose that you do WorldSkill, because that was going to be more valuable for you as a skill, and to show to an employer how much extra time they had put in. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that was absolutely fine, as long as it was right for that learner's future. But if a learner wanted to go into a particular sector and they were not accepted, it was not comparable."

It was generally a question that people asked, and the learners usually had not had the best experience pre 16 and that's why they asked the question straight away. The answer was that it was about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners. If they didn't offer the range, which, sometimes\u2014if you, obviously, limit and made qualifications compulsory, that can limit the choice of opportunities as well."

However, it would be very difficult for them, as institutions, to change the negative perception.

Now they were trying to do what's in the best interests of the learner, but they were not sure at the moment. Therefore, they needed to go back to the original vision of the Welsh bachelor's degree, which all of them would buy into 100 percent. They needed to spend less time in checking what they had done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do, rather than it being too much of a paper exercise."

Moreover, the teachers were absolutely crucial to this, which was why, first of all, they had taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the new curriculum to give them the time that they needed to make sure that it was not just school leaders but it was individual classroom practitioners who had the skills that would be able to make the most of the opportunity that the new school had to offer.

Industrial Designer suggested that there should be a menu button and a light emitting and a visible button to go to the channel you've been before. Project Manager agreed and suggested that they could make a mute button to indicate that the TV was working. However, Project Manager was not satisfied with this idea because he thought it would be too difficult for old people.

However, there were a number of things that they need to do: they needed to recognise the impact of adverse childhood experiences and how that can help to drive distress and suicidal ideation. They also needed to train teachers so that they had an understanding response and were much more confident in that; they needed listen to the voices of young people themselves. They needed to get more of a child-centred voice around this. Finally, they should have a whole-school approach to the problem."

The first was whether there were actually delays in accessing EOTAS, especially at key stage 4, where obviously you would hold those grades. The second question was about the off-rolling. Dr Ian Johnson thought that there were a number of potential reasons for that. It could be the socio-economic profile, because exclusions, et cetera, were substantially higher amongst those who were eligible for free school meals, and in many parts of Wales the socioeconomic profile of a Welsh-medium education school was slightly different."

Dr Ian also mentioned that the whole-school approach would work within EOTAS, and how they ensure that the provision was available through the medium of Welsh on a national level."

The team also found that most users only used ten percent of the buttons, so it was a big design issue. Also, the team found out that most people did not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall, so they could cut back on cost if they didn't have so many functions on the remote control."

    "summary": "Industrial Designer suggested that one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment, for instance, DVD players, cell phones, video and audio equipment. Users Interface suggested that the remote should work on different TVs or even different devices. However, Project Manager pointed out that they were not developing this product for a specific vendor, so they were going business to consumer."

    "summary": "Industrial Designer proposed that the remote control should be able to fit to every device. User Interface agreed and pointed out that the basic function of the remote should be changing the state of the TV. However, Industrial Designer questioned whether there should be a restriction for the operating range. The group agreed that the range should not be too limited for TV because it was always in the neighbourhood of a TV."

    "summary": "Marketing thought most most things have already been said, like control multiple devices and infrared might be an issue because lots of devices already use infrared. User Interface suggested that the buttons for volume or whatever should be visible in dark so that users can understand what they are doing without looking at the buttons. Industrial Designer also suggested that it would be nice to have display on the remote control so that the users could see functions."
