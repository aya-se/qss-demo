Sorry .", "User Interface: Uh let's see . Which one was mine ?", "Project Manager: So let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough .  Okay , perfect . So we have  Oh no , what's that ?

Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting , so I showed uh show them to you . Oh , sorry about that , I just escape this one . How do I escape this ? How do I I escape this s uh presentation ?", "Industrial Designer: What ?", "User Interface: Uh left .", "Industrial Designer: Uh", "Project Manager: Ah okay .", "User Interface: So", "Industrial Designer: Just  Yeah .", "Project Manager: And show , sorry . Okay , so let's have a look s at this one . Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um  Should be a univ uh universal remote control  No , that's  I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a TV remote control only . So have you changed that part ?", "User Interface: Okay .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Um so  yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um  All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno .", "User Interface: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: Uh so  So  yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh", "User Interface: Which one first ?", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the", "User Interface: Okay .", "Marketing: Mm . Uh", "User Interface: Functional requirements , yeah", "Marketing: Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .", "Project Manager: I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me ,", "Marketing: You didn't read it ?", "Project Manager: I didn't get it uh anyway .", "User Interface: No , I didn don't thing we got it .", "Project Manager: It's only for you .", "Marketing: Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yes .", "Marketing: Okay it was uh uh uh um um  a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the  uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements .", "Project Manager: The last point is quite an interesting", "Marketing: Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .", "Project Manager: So", "Marketing: Um Martijn alr already said it .", "Project Manager: if we  Yeah .", "Marketing: And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but  I don't think it's uh", "Project Manager: Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,", "Marketing: reachable .", "Project Manager: then you're you're", "Marketing: Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you  clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly .", "User Interface: Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .", "Marketing: Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the  thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours TV or something . I don't  We we haven't  Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . Okay , last page .", "Marketing: Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an LCD on the remote control . We already thought about that . Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical . And older people uh want to spend uh more money .  But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . And they want to keep the old uh things the old things .", "Project Manager: So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .", "Marketing: But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?", "Project Manager: People . So yeah , so we just can skip the LCD r on the remote control ,", "Marketing: I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: because  Yeah .", "Marketing: because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .", "Project Manager: It's too  Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Um then  I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's  not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I   If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise .", "Project Manager: Because it's too expensive . Yeah , probably .", "Marketing: Yeah , only only for television uh  On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .", "User Interface: Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .", "Marketing: Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a  a new product . We have to be um  Yeah . One of a kind , I think .", "Project Manager: So it has to look uh uh uh unique ,", "User Interface: Unique .", "Marketing: The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .", "Project Manager: but  Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , I reckon", "Project Manager: But old people are not looking for that .", "User Interface: Uh I think mm", "Project Manager: Not really .", "User Interface: Uh", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah ,", "Project Manager: Okay . Yeah .", "Marketing: to k to keep it simple when you", "User Interface: But uh we also have to stand out ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Sorry I thought about it , yes .", "User Interface: 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape ,", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay .", "User Interface: so", "Marketing: Okay , this was uh my presentation .", "Project Manager: Thanks .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: I don't", "Project Manager: So", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Paul , you can do the next one if you want .", "Marketing: You can ask some questions or something .", "User Interface: Okay . Yeah well  Uh .", "Project Manager: It's on the on the uh net net uh thing ,", "User Interface: There it is .", "Project Manager: isn't it ?", "User Interface: Okay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't  that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .", "Project Manager: So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or", "User Interface: Yeah , I have it on the next page .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: to find out . But there is already in a one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to  . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh  Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . Or not ?", "Project Manager: Maybe i maybe it's too complicated ,", "User Interface: No y", "Project Manager: but not sure  .", "User Interface: Well", "Project Manager: It's a good idea , but", "User Interface: it's  It was just a thought . So I'm , I u  I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?", "User Interface: Well uh", "Project Manager: Uh", "User Interface: what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ?", "User Interface: So uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel .", "User Interface: Well if you said a favourite", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and", "Project Manager: Uh mayb for me it's", "User Interface: Well i", "Project Manager: If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never .", "User Interface: Never ? Oh .", "Industrial Designer: No , neither do I .", "Project Manager: So", "User Interface: Oh are you ?", "Project Manager: And", "User Interface: Okay now , m maybe not .", "Project Manager: If I don't do it , maybe old people", "User Interface: No , maybe elderly people uh . Right .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno .", "User Interface: They don't like new features . So maybe not .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Um well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable", "Project Manager: It's not , it's still not  It's not anymore n uh", "User Interface: when  Not anymore for TV .", "User Interface: Right , on off .  I dunno , miss  Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for TV .", "Marketing: Um", "Project Manager: Just on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need .", "User Interface: Is", "Industrial Designer: Uh uh the p uh next and previous .

Like a web browser back button .", "User Interface: Um I dunno .", "Project Manager: Uh  Yeah ,", "User Interface: I don't have  Uh I did", "Project Manager: I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people .", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Marketing: No . Uh", "User Interface: I don't think you use that . Y only when you want to go to", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "User Interface: Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time .", "Project Manager: And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Normally you can press one , zero or", "User Interface: Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh", "Project Manager: A ten plus or", "User Interface: Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: To just keep it simple and standard uh features .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh  Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people", "User Interface: Uh yeah mayb", "Marketing: It gets some seconds .", "User Interface: But I think that's in the TV as well . That's how the uh the TV TV handles it . But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes .", "Industrial Designer: Oh okay . Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , it's it's no it's not a", "User Interface: So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but that's th mm", "Marketing: It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the TV um do one two . It's the TV who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: So if you have a universal TV controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that  And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .", "Project Manager: But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f", "Marketing: It's only for television now .", "User Interface: So I I don't think so .", "Project Manager: No .", "User Interface: Uh I just thought of another one .", "Marketing: No .", "User Interface: Most things in modern TVs are also on the menu .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh  But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: so you have", "Industrial Designer: I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button .", "User Interface: four arrows .", "Industrial Designer: Because you n almost never use menu button .", "User Interface: Yeah , okay ,", "Industrial Designer: So", "User Interface: but um", "Project Manager: Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to", "User Interface: Yeah , a mute button . Yes .", "Project Manager: Maybe , not", "User Interface: Don't think so .", "Project Manager: I don't know where where you have to put it .", "User Interface: Yeah well ,", "User Interface: that's that's  I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use .", "Project Manager: Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right .", "User Interface: And later we can d uh do the design .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic  Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our TV controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Does it have to be  Uh it has to be uh with different colours", "User Interface: Um  I dunno . Different colours um", "Project Manager: or", "Marketing: Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow", "Project Manager: It's like a iMac or something .", "Marketing: or", "Project Manager: Just to make it", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Yeah . Well why not ? Or  Yeah .", "Marketing: That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion .", "Project Manager: But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it", "User Interface: Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .", "Project Manager: Oh , you just  I dunno what happened .", "User Interface: Oh .", "User Interface: Who ?", "Project Manager: Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . Just", "User Interface: They they're uh designed very well .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . You think you can't make a TV controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: But uh well , I think that's a good example .", "Project Manager: Okay ,", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it .", "User Interface: Okay , sorry .", "Project Manager: Is it fin Are you finished ?", "User Interface: Well uh", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um  Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh  Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh  And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the TV . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things", "Project Manager: So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?", "Industrial Designer: but  Yeah . I I think so .", "User Interface: Uh j Is", "Industrial Designer: I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .", "Project Manager: Yeah , it's  I think it's usable .", "User Interface: Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?", "Marketing: Yeah , that's active .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Or just a green one ,", "User Interface: So", "Project Manager: because it's  If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .", "User Interface: Yeah . Maybe uh", "Marketing: I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , when you press it .", "Project Manager: But if you", "Industrial Designer: So", "Marketing: I it's it's just uh the the", "Project Manager: Red's l shows up like something's wrong ,", "Industrial Designer: Two ?", "Project Manager: and green is like it's okay , you press the button .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno .", "User Interface: Maybe depends on uh", "Industrial Designer: Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I know .", "User Interface: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay , we make it red .", "User Interface: But maybe", "Industrial Designer: So", "User Interface: Well", "Industrial Designer: I know .", "User Interface: we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well .", "Project Manager: You have to  The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . Uh that's cool .", "Industrial Designer: I I think uh the batteries will be uh  a little", "User Interface: Uh   Oh ,", "Marketing: Empty .", "User Interface: maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh", "Project Manager: No , we have a recharger in it , so", "User Interface: Oh .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: If we can still make that then", "Industrial Designer: Uh maybe .", "User Interface: Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red .", "User Interface: It's just to indicate something's on .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low .", "Project Manager: But it's cool if it was green .", "User Interface: Yeah . It's it's not very important ,", "Project Manager: Green or red or whatever , it is cool .", "User Interface: so yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working .", "User Interface: So mm", "Industrial Designer: And uh the receptor in the TV senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the TVs . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the  Otherwise it won't work .", "User Interface: So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh", "Industrial Designer: No . I I uh  The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: An automatically search function for each television , or something .", "Industrial Designer: That are working . Yeah , or  I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there .", "User Interface: Well , I I use a universal uh remote control ,", "Marketing: Uh I kno", "User Interface: and  list of all the TVs you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , so it works on your TV .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay .", "Marketing: Oh , I have a modern one .", "Marketing: And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it ,", "Industrial Designer: Ah okay .", "Marketing: and then it's okay . So you don't have to search for your television or your code .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: It uh search uh the pattern for itself .", "User Interface: Okay ,", "Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah .", "User Interface: so we use that .", "Industrial Designer: So it uh  We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to", "Marketing: Yes .", "User Interface: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: I just say  Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking  There's just a short", "Industrial Designer: Uh okay . Well uh y you have this chip .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: But uh ma basically for uh brands of TV these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one TV it go go to one . And on the other TV it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .", "Marketing: Changing the signal .", "Industrial Designer: And um  What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so  And then he saves that setting", "Project Manager: Okay . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and then um it's working .", "Marketing: Yeah , that's the right uh option .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Well uh the components .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't  I w I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Um that's connecting to all the components .", "Industrial Designer: Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .", "Project Manager: Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too .", "Industrial Designer: But this one is producing infrared light", "Project Manager: Yeah , okay .", "Industrial Designer: that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light .", "Project Manager: So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . To flash up your", "Industrial Designer: Yeah", "Marketing: Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can  Basically if the battery is low , it won't work .", "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah , and", "Project Manager: Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button .", "Industrial Designer: Huh , that's a good idea .", "Marketing: Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal .", "User Interface: No , y Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: And it's  you also know which button you p", "Marketing: But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right . But it", "Marketing: Everywhere in the r", "Project Manager: But does it make any difference for the energy you use ?

There . Yeah .", "Marketing: Maybe uh", "Project Manager: The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ?", "User Interface: Yeah , we're thinking about it .", "Project Manager: If you push", "User Interface: Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh", "Project Manager: It lights up . Everything lights up . That's a good idea .", "User Interface: everything lights up . Why ain't that on a remote control ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much .", "User Interface: Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: It's f Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well .", "User Interface: Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: No , I dunno . But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use", "Marketing: Yeah ,", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's a good idea , okay .", "Marketing: I uh", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . We'll have enough power", "Project Manager: Everything agre", "Industrial Designer: to", "Project Manager: Everyone agrees with that , or  Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yep .", "Marketing: Maybe what Paul said , uh under the  on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps .", "Project Manager: Yeah , and then you  Okay , yeah . But you have to make a sound device in it then .", "User Interface: And also it's", "Marketing: Yeah , there must be sound in it .", "Project Manager: But", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Okay , it shouldn't take much", "Marketing: I dunno .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . Because it's i it has to be", "Marketing: Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it .", "User Interface: Uh I th", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .", "Marketing: Bec Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "User Interface: I think uh you also have uh  remote controls with a lot of options .", "Marketing: So", "User Interface: But we lose about ninety percent of those options . So I think you can uh", "Marketing: Uh . We have to give our customers some extras .", "User Interface: Yeah . I think we will save money with that .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: Okay . Are you almost finished or just", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out .", "Project Manager: Okay . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Because I was short on time .", "Project Manager: No worry .", "Industrial Designer: But um  Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I just want to talk some  about some more . So maybe you have to  Yeah ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ?", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: So this  Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ? So uh  Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are . They're still in um  Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . I'm not sure . I don't think so ,", "Industrial Designer: No ,", "Project Manager: but", "Industrial Designer: and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .", "Marketing: No .", "Project Manager: Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Uh .", "Project Manager: We definitely should use it . Um", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Oh . Mm .", "User Interface: Okay , that's  It changes things .", "Project Manager: I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well .", "Project Manager: So does it make some decision about that ?", "Marketing: Changes .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Um", "Industrial Designer: That kinda changes the whole situation .", "Marketing: Uh", "User Interface: Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,", "Project Manager: That still stays .", "User Interface: to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: That's important I think and", "Marketing: LCD doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .", "User Interface: And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have TV functions on it .", "Marketing: Oh .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So", "Industrial Designer: Mm ah  I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you", "Marketing: Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay .  No , it's not", "User Interface: Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable .", "Industrial Designer: No .", "User Interface: So , but uh  Yeah . What other features can we put in ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the  Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .", "Marketing: But uh some of you had uh something to read about um  uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ?", "Industrial Designer: I didn't read", "Marketing: That's very  That's fancy . That's cool .", "User Interface: It's very fashion .", "Industrial Designer: I didn't read any", "Marketing: Twelve and you've got twelve .", "Industrial Designer: b Yeah . Yeah okay .", "User Interface: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: I I know .", "Marketing: Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing .

But", "Marketing: If it's possible ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,", "Project Manager: I don't think it's very expensive actually .", "Industrial Designer: I don't know .", "Marketing: I dunno . I didn't read it .", "User Interface: Mm .", "Project Manager: Why should it ?", "User Interface: Yeah , I think it's", "Marketing: Uh if i if i", "Project Manager: You only have a microphone in it .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: I didn't have information about that .", "Industrial Designer: But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or", "Project Manager: Nah , maybe", "Marketing: Ah that's a problem , but", "Industrial Designer: And and uh w Yeah ?", "Marketing: Uh only in English . Only in English I think .", "User Interface: What  But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh  Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but", "User Interface: uh one to have in channel one ?", "Marketing: No , that  Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do  do we do it ?", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Marketing: It's more if we if we do it .", "User Interface: I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at .", "Industrial Designer: And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: or", "Project Manager: Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that .", "User Interface: Is", "Project Manager: It  We have short time to to put it on the market ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno .", "Project Manager: so that  We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .", "User Interface: Mm  Yeah well", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think so .", "Project Manager: We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy .", "Marketing: Yeah , and uh and uh", "User Interface: It's", "Marketing: In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: I d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .", "Industrial Designer: And and", "Project Manager: Yeah . I think so .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh", "Marketing: Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the TV turns uh to one .", "Industrial Designer: the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay .", "Marketing: Yeah ,", "User Interface: Yeah . Well yeah ,", "Marketing: it's not uh", "User Interface: that's the right command . And then you have to say uh TV channel one , or something . Not just one ,", "Industrial Designer: But  Hmm yeah , TV one .", "User Interface: but", "Marketing: Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition .", "User Interface: Well I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: So", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: we have to make some decisions . So", "Marketing: Okay , no speech recognition .", "Project Manager: you can see on the uh  So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do", "User Interface: Yeah , I think so .", "Project Manager: If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's good .", "Project Manager: Okay , we just take that one .", "User Interface: Yep .", "Project Manager: And what else , we have", "User Interface: Also the one in the dark . So uh  It lights up when it's dark ?", "Project Manager: Yeah , but it's  Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same .", "User Interface: I didn't", "Project Manager: If you push something , it it all lights up .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah yeah ,", "User Interface: Yeah , but um", "Marketing: it it mustn't work all the time .", "User Interface: Yes , that's what I mean .", "Marketing: It uh uh it have to work only when you use it .", "Project Manager: Or you can switch it on or something .", "Marketing: So if you", "User Interface: Or maybe when you", "Marketing: No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .", "User Interface: yeah . It lights up all .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right . You have to  Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .", "User Interface: Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah .", "Project Manager: And do we use a a  Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac ,  if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control .", "User Interface: Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod .", "Industrial Designer: Mm , maybe it's a good idea .", "User Interface: Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Like uh phones .", "Marketing: Oh yeah .", "Project Manager: Different colours . Okay ,", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: so y you just make it th through  You look through it ?", "Marketing: A see-through . Mm , that's cool .", "User Interface: Yeah . Uh as an option maybe .", "Project Manager: Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top ,", "User Interface: It's the standard", "Project Manager: and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there .", "User Interface: Yeah , uh  Yeah ,", "Marketing: But you have  You had a lot of different buttons .", "User Interface: we but we don't  We don't really have any complicated buttons .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Yeah , maybe you have you have to  Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .", "User Interface: Yeah okay , but  Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little", "Project Manager: O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it .", "User Interface: No , I don't need don't need  Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right .", "User Interface: I use teletext as well .", "Industrial Designer: So uh", "Marketing: No , I use te teletext every day , I think .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm . Okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons ,", "Marketing: Mm .", "User Interface: I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: 'Cause  simple buttons .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: If you put one above it , it's clear .", "Project Manager: Okay . So that's it for toda for  We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um", "User Interface: How long is lunch break ?", "Project Manager: So yeah , you know what you have to do .
