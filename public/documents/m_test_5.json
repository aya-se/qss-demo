I could borrow ?", "Grad A: Oh yeah .", "Professor B: OK , so uh i um I don't know whether Ami 's coming or not um but I think we oughta just get started .", "Grad E: Nancy is uh currently in Berkeley but not here ?", "Grad C: Nancy 's still stick ?", "Professor B: Don't know . Anyway", "Grad E: OK .", "Professor B: Oh , so there you go . Anyway , so my idea f for today and we can uh decide that that isn't the right thing to do was to at  spend at least part of the time trying to eh build the influence links , you know which sets of things are uh relevant to which decisions and actually I had uh specific s suggestion to start first with the path ones . The database ones being in some sense less interesting to us although probably have to be done and so to do that so there 's  and the idea was we were gonna do two things", "Grad C: Is your mike on ?", "Professor B: Ah . Oh right , well . Yeah . We were gonna do two things one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what", "Grad D: That 's funny .", "Professor B: and then as a uh separate but related task uh particularly Bhaskara and I were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to um do what we  what we need to do . Once so but du we should sort of have all of the uh basic design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to compute it . So I didn't  did you get a chance to look at all  yet ?", "Grad D: Yeah , I looked at some of that stuff .", "Professor B: Great . OK so let 's start with the uh belief - nets , the general influence stuff and then we 'll  then we 'll also at some point break and talk about the techy stuff .", "Grad E: Well I think one could go there 's I think we can di discuss everything . First of all this I added , I knew from sort of basically this has to be there right ? Um", "Professor B: Oh are you gonna go there or not ? Yeah , so one i", "Grad E: Given  given uh uh not transverse the castle , the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just", "Professor B: Right , true . Does have to be there . And I 'm sure we 'll find more as we go that", "Grad E: And Hmm ? So Go - there in the first place or not is definitely uh one of the basic ones . We can start with that . Interesting effect . Um Is this basically true or false or maybe we 'll get", "Professor B: Well", "Grad D: Which one ?", "Grad E: what ?", "Grad A: \" Go there \" .", "Grad E: m right .", "Professor B: so there is this question about", "Grad E: Here we we actually get just probabilities ,", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad E: right for each down here .", "Professor B: When we 're  yeah when we 're done . So  so", "Grad E: Hmm .", "Professor B: the  the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when so it 's , you know uh current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all ,", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: right ? And so that a decision would be do we want that so you could  two different things you could do , you could have all those values for Go - there or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when .", "Grad E: When . How .", "Professor B: Yeah and so forth .", "Grad E: Why ,", "Professor B: So I 'll let", "Grad E: yeah .", "Professor B: we 'll see .", "Grad E: Hmm ?", "Grad A: I mean it seems that you could um uh it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would wanna have them separate or binary , Go - there and then the  the possibilities of how to go there because", "Professor B: OK , that 's  let 's start that way .", "Grad A: because , you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time .", "Grad E: Hmm . Hmm . OK . And so I 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe so who is the user ? Everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A . We should be be clear . But when it comes to sort of writing down when you  when you do these things is it here ? You sort of have to a write the values this can take .", "Professor B: Right .", "Grad E: And here I was really uh in some s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because um  this case it 's pretty simple , but as we will see the other ones um for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished .", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Professor B: No uh", "Grad E: How can I write here that this is something , a number that cr keeps on changing ? But OK . Thus is understandable ?", "Grad A: Think so .", "Grad C: Yes .", "Grad E: So here for example .", "Professor B: You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith , these belief - net things ?", "Grad A: Uh , no , but I think I 'm following it . So far .", "Grad E: So here is the  the  we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions .", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad D: Hmm .", "Grad E: There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things .", "Grad D: Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? OK , h well I mean how is it different from user finance ?", "Grad E: Um the finance is sort of here thought of as  as the financial policy a person carries out in his life , he  is he cheap , average , or spendy ?", "Grad D: Alright .", "Grad E: And um I didn't come uh maybe a user I don't know , I didn't want to write greediness , but", "Grad A: Yeah . Hmm .", "Professor B: Or cheapness .", "Grad E: Welcome .", "Grad A: User thrift .", "Grad E: Welcome .", "Professor B: Thrift , that 's good .", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Professor B: Great .", "Grad E: There it is .", "Professor B: Yeah . So Keith w what 's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: So this is not just a display , this is actually a GUI to a simulator that will if we tell it all the right things we 'll wind up with a functioning belief - net at the other end .", "Grad A: OK . OK .", "Grad E: And it 's so simple even I can use it .", "Grad A: Wow , that is simple .", "Grad E: OK , so here was OK , I can think of uh people being cheap , average , or spendy or we can even have a  a finer scale moderately cheap ,", "Professor B: Doesn't matter .", "Grad E: doesn't matter . Agree there but here um I wasn't sure what to write in .", "Professor B: Let 's  go ahead .", "Grad D: Well , I mean you 've written in  you 've written in what uh seems to be required like what else is  is do you want ?", "Grad E: If that 's permissible then I 'm happy .", "Professor B: Well yeah . So here 's  here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gonna have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? It 's  you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief - net . Right ?", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: And then what you 're going to need is uh for the things that it influences . Well let 's  first of all let 's see if it does influence anything . And if it does influence anything then you 're gonna need something that converts from the  the number here to something that 's relevant to the decision there . So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever  but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things .", "Grad E: Hmm . Yeah  this is where um OK anyways let 's forget it .", "Professor B: Well that 's fine . Well anyway , go ahead .", "Grad E: OK , and so this , oh that", "Grad D: The other thing is that um every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you  do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ?", "Professor B: Yeah , that 's a good question . And uh does it have a lazy mode ? I don't remember .", "Grad D: Uh Well , I mean , in Srini 's thing there was this thing  there was this um option like proper inferences which suggests that uh doesn't happen , automatically .", "Professor B: Oh right . Yeah . S probably does . Yeah someone has to track that down , but I  but uh And  and  and I think  actually uh", "Grad E: I just accidentally Oops .", "Professor B: one of the we w items for the uh user home base uh should be uh essentially non - local . I they 're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they 're staying .", "Grad D: Well", "Grad E: Oh just uh accidentally erased this , I  I just had values here such as uh um is he s we had in our list we had \" Is he staying in our hotel ? \" , \" Is he staying with friends ? \" , and so forth", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad E: uh so we 're OK .", "Professor B: So it 's clear where w w w where we are right now . So my suggestion is we just pick uh", "Grad E: Something down here ?", "Professor B: one , you know one uh particular one of the uh well let 's do the first  first one let 's do the one that we sort of already think we did so w that was the  of the endpoint ?", "Grad E: Mm - hmm . And um Oops .", "Grad D: Is hmm", "Grad E: Ah ,", "Grad D: So it 's true or false ?", "Professor B: No , that 's  that 's a", "Grad E: OK . No no no , EVA .", "Grad D: So", "Grad E: Missed that one .", "Grad C: What 's the difference between mode and endpoint ?", "Grad D: I thought mode , yeah .", "Professor B: although that", "Grad E: Um mode was um", "Professor B: Well , that 's", "Grad D: Mode of transportation ?", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad D: OK . Also true or false .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: No , he has he hasn't filled them in yet , is what 's true .", "Grad D: Yeah , OK .", "Grad E: Did I or didn't I ?  Ah . Probably nothing done yet , oh I just did it on the upper ones , OK . Makes sense . OK , so this was EVA . Maybe we can think of more things , cross", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Grad A: Climb , rob .", "Professor B: OK .", "Grad E: climb , emerge", "Professor B: No no no , these are ju that 's just a point ,", "Grad C: Uh", "Grad D: Well some of those are subsumed by approach .", "Professor B: this is ju", "Grad C: Would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it ?", "Grad A: The Charles Bridge , you know .", "Professor B: Yeah , would be a f for a given segment . You know , you  y you go  first go the town square", "Grad C: Well I eh", "Grad A: No , I mean , if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your  your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge and doesn't really matter which way you cross which  where you end up at the end but the part  the good part is walking over it , so .", "Professor B: That 's subtle , but true . Anyway so let 's just leave it three  with three for now", "Grad E: Mm - hmm , mmm . Yeah .", "Professor B: and let 's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started .", "Grad E: OK , we", "Professor B: You 'll see it  you 'll see something comes up immediately , that the reason I wanna do this .", "Grad E: w well the uh user was uh definitely more likely to enter if he 's a local", "Professor B: Right . Right .", "Grad E: more likely to view if he 's a tourist um and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um", "Professor B: We did , but the three things w that  that it contributed to this in fact , the other two aren't up there . so one was the ontology", "Grad E: We 'll d what type of building is it ?", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: And the  and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse .", "Grad E: What he has mentioned before .", "Professor B: OK , so this is w Right , so what w I  what we seem to need here , this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff", "Grad A: mm - hmm", "Professor B: the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . So each of those the way we had it designed , now we can change the design , but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations", "Grad A: mm - hmm", "Professor B: so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes", "Grad E: Uh we can load it up it you know very simple .", "Grad A: So", "Professor B: and then what you and I have to talk about is , OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ? But the  they 're  they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about .", "Grad E: So this was adjusted for this one mode thing .", "Grad D: Oh yes .", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad E: So that 's w w in our uh in  in Johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something .", "Professor B: Oh , it was called mode , so this  this is m mode here means the same as endpoint .", "Grad E: Is now this endpoint .", "Grad C: Right .", "Professor B: OK , why don't we ch can we change that ?", "Grad E: We can just rename that , yeah .", "Professor B: Alright . You know , but that was actually , yeah unfortunately that was a um kind of an intermediate versio that 's I don't think what we would currently do .", "Grad A: Can I ask about \" slurred \" and \" angry \" as inputs to this ?", "Professor B: That 's a", "Grad A: What  why ?", "Grad D: Like they 're either true or false", "Grad E: The prosody ?", "Grad A: OK .", "Grad D: and they uh oh I see .", "Grad C: If the  if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK . Drunk .", "Grad D: Therefore", "Grad C: And , you know , possibly uh", "Grad A: Less likely to enter .", "Grad C: some ,", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Grad C: yeah .", "Grad D: uh I was thinking less likely to view", "Professor B: Yeah . But that 's - that seems to , yeah . So  so my advice to do is  is get this down to what we think is actually likely to  to be a  a strong influence .", "Grad A: OK .", "Professor B: But yeah , that was what he had in mind .", "Grad D: Right .", "Professor B: So let 's think about this  this question of how do we wanna handle  so there 're two separate things . One is  uh at least two . One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that I think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . So the  let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing , the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: OK , et cetera . So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set , so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: Now", "Grad E: Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in  in  in some of the other final decisions done here , for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um", "Professor B: Right . Right .", "Grad E: if it 's exhibiting itself it is a landmark ,", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad E: meaning more likely to be viewed", "Professor B: Yep .", "Grad E: if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this , then it 's more likely to be entered .", "Professor B: I uh that 's  I think that 's completely right and um I think that 's good , right ? So what  what that says is that we might be able to uh take and in particular so  so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling", "Grad E: Accessibility .", "Professor B: no , accessibility meant", "Grad E: If it 's closed one probably won't enter . Or if it 's not accessible to a tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it ,", "Professor B: OK .", "Grad E: given that he knows it , of course .", "Professor B: Alright . So let me suggest this . Uh w could you move those up about halfway . Uh The ones that you th And selling I guess .", "Grad E: Yeah , all  all of these if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things", "Professor B: Right . So here  here 's what it looks like to me . is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of  of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . So that it uh that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other . Does that seem right ? So we di", "Grad C: Basic you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ?", "Professor B: if we Yes .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: So if  well it may be more than endpoint decisions , so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three", "Grad E: These three ?", "Professor B: Yeah . Eh ser s uh selling , fixing , and servicing .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad D: What ex um and so either those is true f or false ?", "Professor B: Uh Uh well it  it  i here 's where it gets a little tricky .", "Grad D: So", "Professor B: Uh from the belief - net point of view it is from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's  it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth .", "Grad A: Yeah .", "Professor B: So for this decision it 's just uh true or false", "Grad D: OK . Yeah .", "Professor B: and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want .", "Grad D: OK .", "Professor B: That  that if any of those things is true then it 's the kind of place that you uh", "Grad E: Um more likely to enter .", "Professor B: are more likely to enter .", "Grad D: So you just wanna have them all pointing to a summary thing ?", "Professor B: You could , yeah . Yeah , so let 's do that . No no , no eh to  to an inter no , an intermediate node .", "Grad D: T", "Grad E: Oh , OK .", "Professor B: That 's the p part of the idea , is", "Grad E: Um is  is that the object type node ?", "Professor B: I d", "Grad E: So are they the  is it the kind of object that sells , fixes , or services things ?", "Professor B: Well , o open up object type and let 's see what its values are .", "Grad E: Oh I just created it , it has none so far .", "Professor B: Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects , we called them entities , right ?", "Grad E: Yeah . And then we have sort of the um", "Professor B: Let 's say I put commercial .", "Grad E: Yeah , I w I was just gonna commercial action inside where people p", "Professor B: Well couldn't I do  let 's do commercial uh landmark and", "Grad E: And where was the accessible , yeah .", "Professor B: Well accessible I think is different cuz that 's tempor that  that varies temporally ,", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: whereas this is a", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: What would a hotel fall under ?", "Professor B: I would call that a service , but  but I don't know .", "Grad C: Well I mean in terms of entity type ?", "Professor B: Say w w well it 's co I would s a a again for this purpose I think it 's commercial . Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business .", "Grad C: OK .", "Grad D: Um what does the underscore - T at the end of each of those things signify ?", "Grad E: Um things . So places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things .", "Grad D: Uh - huh . OK . OK . That also points to entity type I guess .", "Grad A: So we 're deriving um this  the  this feature of whether the  the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ? Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity ?", "Professor B: Well you could , that 's a  that 's a choice .", "Grad A: OK .", "Professor B: So uh", "Grad A: I mean it seems like that 's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and you know indoor places that do something else", "Professor B: Yeah , the problem with it is that it sort of putting in a feature just for one decision ,", "Grad A: and Hmm .", "Professor B: now w we may wind up having to do that this i anyway , this i", "Grad A: OK .", "Professor B: at a mental level that 's what we we 're gonna have to sort out .", "Grad A: OK .", "Professor B: So , you know what does this look like , what are  what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing , what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: and what 's the best way to organize this so that um it 's clean and  and consistent and all that sort of stuff .", "Grad A: OK . I 'm just thinking about how people , human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this and it would probably  you wouldn't just sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that it must be going on inside or something .", "Grad E: Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things ,", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: it 's not either or mmm certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: Many come to mind . Things can be generally um a landmark and be accessible .

Yeah .", "Grad C: Just as a suggestion maybe you could \" save as \" to keep your old one nice and clean and so you can mess with this one .", "Grad E: Mmm .

Anyway th so in general this is the design , this is really design problem .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: OK , you 've got a signal , a d set of decisions um how do we do this ?", "Grad E: What do I have under user state anyhow cuz I named that already something . Oh that 's tired , fresh , yeah . Maybe should be renamed into physical state .", "Professor B: Or fat user fatigue even .", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Grad E: That 's with a \" G \" ?", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: Whatever .", "Grad E: Then we can make a user state .", "Professor B: What 's th what we 're talking about is compatibility . Uh or something , I don't know , but .", "Grad C: I guess the  the question uh is It 's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again . Or user compatibility .", "Professor B: Oh but the thing is that we uh uh we had some things that uh", "Grad E: That don't .", "Professor B: that don't", "Grad E: The user interests and the user who  who  who the user is are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke", "Grad C: Sure , but other  I thought though the node we 're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action , right ?", "Professor B: the right", "Grad C: Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something .", "Professor B: Uh maybe not . I mean the  that 's the  the issue is um would Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of . And anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible .", "Grad E: Maybe um if we look at the  if we split it up again into sort of um if we look at the uh the endpoint again we  we said that for each of these things there are certain preconditions so you can only enter a place if you are not too tired to do so and also eh have the money to do so if it costs something so if you can afford it and perform it is preconditions .

I don't know .", "Grad C: Well , with the way we 're defining it I think yeah .", "Professor B: W w but that eh viewing it without ent yeah view w with our definition of view it 's free cuz you", "Grad E: And so is approaching .", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad A: Well what about the Grand Canyon , right ?

So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either  yep , yay , A , or nay . Yeah .

So yeah , that 's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this  that node by itself wouldn't distinguish", "Professor B: Well i i it can have di various values .

I see that could be .", "Grad A: Also , that node , I mean the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the", "Professor B: Could be . Yeah . N", "Grad D: Like situation traffic and so on .", "Grad A: Yeah , the time of day .", "Professor B: Yeah . Yeah . So  so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision", "Grad D: I guess the final", "Professor B: maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node .

Because that 's what we , I mean that 's why this situation comes up .", "Professor B: Yeah . Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed  feed into the Go - there S That 's right ,", "Grad D: Yeah , right .", "Professor B: so the Endpoint node ,", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: make that up t t to the Go - there then", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that .

Well , but the good thing is we  we could have loopy belief propagation which  we all love .", "Grad E: Mmm .", "Professor B: Right . OK , so anyway , so that 's another decision . Uh what 's  what 's another decision you like ?", "Grad E: OK , these have no parents yet , but I guess that sort of doesn't matter . Right ?", "Professor B: Well , the idea is that you go there , you go comes from something about the user from something about the situation and the uh the discourse is  is a mystery .", "Grad E: I mean this is sort of This comes from traffic and so forth , yeah . Sh - Should we just make some", "Professor B: Sure , if you want .", "Grad E: um if there 's parking maybe Mmm Oh who cares . OK . And if he has seen it already or not and so forth ,", "Professor B: Right .", "Grad E: OK .

Oops . Have to get used to this . OK , whoops .", "Grad A: Um actually", "Professor B: And then also the discourse endpoint , I  I guess endpoint sub - D is  if you wanna make it consistent .", "Grad C: Wh - ah .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: Um actually is this the  the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because isn't the , I mean", "Professor B: I think so . S", "Grad A: uh , hmm OK . But that still allows for the possibility of the  of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from", "Professor B: Maybe not , a Right .", "Grad A: That  all that  that kind of decision making happens at the Go - there node .", "Professor B: Uh y you  yeah you  i you  if you needed to do that .", "Grad A: Uh . If you needed it to do that .", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad A: But uh OK I was just thinking I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible  possible asking of the user", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad A: you know hey there 's a strike on , uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something", "Professor B: Ah . Good point , I don't  I don't know how we 're going to  t uh", "Grad A: or Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model but , you know , directly out of interaction .", "Professor B: Right . Uh I gu yes my curr you know , don't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: Uh My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things", "Grad A: OK .", "Professor B: you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ?", "Grad A: Yeah .", "Professor B: But uh if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ?", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK .", "Professor B: But I think trying to formulate the conditional question , that sounds too much .", "Grad A: Right , right . Yeah . Right , sure , OK .", "Professor B: To me .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: Alright , but let me  let  let 's stay with this a minute", "Grad E: But", "Professor B: because I want to do a little bit of organization . Before we get more into details . The organization is going to be that uh the flavor of what 's going on is going to be that uh as we s e sort of going to this detail indeed Keith is going to  to worry about the various constructions that people might use", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: and Johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard ,", "Grad A: Alright .", "Professor B: so what 's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates , OK uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net .

So uh if there is an and there is mode of transportation", "Grad E: And it there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said what 's the utterance go giving us", "Professor B: Yeah .", "Grad E: and then what 's the discourse history give us .", "Professor B: Yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide uh how much of th where that goes .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: That 's uh two things then .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: Mmm .", "Professor B: an and it 's not clear yet .

Yeah , I  I mean , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes .", "Professor B: Right . Yeah , and Um I  that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into , but um we have to know what we want first . OK , so why don't you tell us a little bit about decision nodes and what  what the choices might be for these ?", "Grad D: So Ah , sorry . I guess that 's", "Grad C: You can technically wear that as you 're talking .", "Grad D: Yeah , it 's right , I guess I can do that .", "Grad A: Darn .", "Professor B: Put it in your , yeah .", "Grad D: I guess this board works fine . So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . Right ? So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down . So what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set , right ? These are all like saying EV or A , right ? So it 's not just a generalized situation like I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of  we wanna view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wanna sort of combine their decisions and create you know , um sorta weighted combination .", "Grad E: Hmm . ROVER , the ROVER decision .", "Grad D: The what decision ?", "Grad E: ROVER . All of their outputs combined to make a decision .", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Grad D: Yeah . Yeah . So the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those , right ? That 's the way belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ? So um that 's what we want , we want for example P of um let 's call this guy Y and let 's call these X - one , X - two XN , right . So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example um E given that these guys are I 'll just refer to this as like X um hat or something , uh the co like all of them ? Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something right ?", "Professor B: Yep .", "Grad D: So we would like to do this kind of combination .", "Professor B: Alright , so um Is that uh I  yeah , I just wanna make sure everybody is with us before he goes on .", "Grad A: I think so , yeah .", "Professor B: It 's  it 's cl e is  is it clear what he wants to compute ?", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: Right . So , right . So Basically um  what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E , s give a number", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: because that 's obviously not desirable . What we wanna do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to um add up to one , right ?", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Grad D: So those are the two things that we uh need . So what uh I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages , right ? So for example here two people have voted for A , one has voted for V , and one has voted for E , so we could say that the probabilities are , you know , probability of being E is one over four , because one person voted for E out of four and similarly , probability of so this is probability of E s and then probability of A given all that is um two out of four and probability of V is one out of four . Right ? So that 's step  that 's the uh yeah that 's the  that 's the basic uh thing . Now", "Grad E: Um Yeah .", "Grad D: Is that all OK ?", "Grad E: And that one outcome , that 's", "Professor B: What ?", "Grad E: it 's X  X - one voted for A X - two voted for V", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: and so forth ?", "Professor B: Y right . Yep .", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which may or may not be a good assumption ,", "Grad E: That 's the outcome .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . Right .", "Professor B: so that", "Grad D: Yeah . Yeah . So step two is um right . So we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh", "Grad C: X - one matters more i than X - two or", "Grad D: Right . Sure , so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth so we could replace this by uh W - one , W - two , W - three , and W - four", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Grad D: right ? And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each um X - hat , we just need that the W 's sum to one . So they can be for example , you know you  you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say .", "Grad E: That 's one .", "Grad D: And that 'd be one . So that um also seems to work fine . And uh", "Grad C: So I jus just to make sure I understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ?", "Grad D: You 'd compute the weighted average , so the probability of E would be uh", "Grad C: OK , so  so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be uh  W one times", "Grad A: Point three .", "Grad C: or A or  let 's see , one full quarter times point one", "Grad D: Not one quarter ,", "Grad A: No .", "Grad D: so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . So you can view these as gone .", "Grad C: OK .", "Grad D: Probability of", "Grad C: OK .", "Grad D: Yeah . Yeah . OK . So , alright . So this is uh step two . So the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert , right , whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called \" H \" , OK ? This is a hidden variable . And what this is is it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four , and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . Right ? And then these guys all come here . OK . So this is sightly uh more complicated . So what 's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . So H produces some you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ? Now this guy he looks at the value of H say it 's two , and then he just selects the uh thing . That 's all there is to say , I guess about it . Right , so you can have a mixture that", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: Right .", "Grad A: So  so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs . It 's driving how the other four are interpreted . OK .", "Grad D: Yeah . Yeah .", "Grad C: So H passes a vector on to the next node ?", "Grad D: It could .", "Grad C: It could ? A vector of the weights as the se", "Grad D: Yeah , it could", "Grad C: oh .", "Grad D: Sorry ?", "Grad A: Well a vector with three zero 's and one one , right ?", "Grad C: Oh it 's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in or which one of the weighting systems", "Grad D: Right , so I mean the way you desc", "Grad C: W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , couldn't you ? OK .", "Grad A: Um Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the  that 's determined by what the experts are saying , like the type of situ OK . Hmm . OK . OK . I mean It  it just seems that like without that  that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if  if uh X - one says no , you know , a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , you know , I mean that seems like that 'd be weird ,", "Grad D: Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also .", "Grad A: right ? Oh , OK . OK . Alright , right .", "Grad C: Oh The situations that H has , are they built into the net or OK , so they  they could either be hand coded or learned or OK .", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Grad C: Based on training data , OK .", "Grad D: Yeah . Yes .", "Grad C: So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . Oh yeah .", "Grad D: Yeah . Um Well , I mean to learn them we need data , where are we gonna get data ? Well I mean we need data with people intentions , right ?", "Grad A: Right , right .", "Grad D: Which is slightly tricky . Right .", "Grad A: Uh - huh .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm . But what 's the data about like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ?", "Grad A: Like how thrifty the user is , or do we have access to that ? Mm - hmm . Oh right . Oh good . OK .", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK .", "Grad D: Yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we  I mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - E , or endpoint sub uh  you know s S ?", "Grad C: Well , basically you would say , based on  in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was ,", "Grad D: Mmm . Mmm .", "Grad C: right ?", "Grad D: So this is what we wanna learn . Yep . Right . Hmm . Yeah . I don't think , well you have a  can you bring up the function thing ? Um w where is the thing that allows you to sort of", "Grad C: That 's on the added variable , isn't it ?", "Grad D: Oh function properties , is that it ? Hmm , I guess not . Yeah , that 's", "Grad A: No .", "Grad D: Right . OK . And um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which I think is unlikely , I think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such CPU 's on your own in the java base format . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because yeah I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's Right . Yeah .", "Grad C: Ah . Well in terms of java base I think it 's basically what you see is what you get in I don't yeah , I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here .", "Grad A: So Yeah . Yeah . By the way um uh just talking about uh about that general end of things uh is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they 're interacting with the system and so on ? Like , I mean , what kind of questions are being given  being asked ? Cuz  OK . Yeah yeah . OK . OK . Fey , you mean . OK . OK . O OK . OK . I 'm just wondering , because in terms of , you know , I mean uh w the figure  I was thinking about this figure that we talked about , fifty constructions or whatever that 's uh that 's a whole lot of constructions and um you know , I mean one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer so , I mean I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . OK . I mean , I  I  I  I was  uh I was talking about the , you know , if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know which fifty do I do , I wanna see what people are using , so Well , it will inspire me . Right , sure sure . Right . Yeah , sure . Sure . Yeah . OK . Touche .
