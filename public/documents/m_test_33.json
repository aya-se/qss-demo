Okay .", "User Interface: Mm .", "Project Manager: Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun .", "User Interface: After lunch . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Right um this is our conceptual design meeting ,", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: um  I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah I was getting that impression as well .", "Project Manager: I th I I think  yeah um .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Project Manager: This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .", "Industrial Designer: Etcetera .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . Um the minutes from the last time . Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um we have decided on a  leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost ,", "Project Manager: things like that ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range .", "User Interface: 'Kay .", "Project Manager: Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ?", "Marketing: Shall I ?", "User Interface: Yep .", "Project Manager: Yes if you feel", "Marketing: Okay . We just connect up .", "Marketing: Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um  the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional  uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,", "Project Manager: It's okay  .", "Marketing: sorry Project Manager  . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .  Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .", "User Interface: 'Kay .", "Project Manager: Okay thank you very much . Um", "User Interface: Yep .", "Project Manager: let's start from the inside and work our way out .", "User Interface: Fine . It's okay with me .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Marketing: Unless anyone has any questions about that ?", "Project Manager: I don't think so , not yet .", "Marketing: Not yet ?

Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the  Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't  un unfortunately aren't available .", "Project Manager: 'Kay .  .", "Industrial Designer: Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the moment .", "Project Manager: 'Kay .", "Industrial Designer: Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .", "Industrial Designer: There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we  I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,", "Project Manager: Wa  can you explain that ?", "Industrial Designer: people won't  it's it's basically like wind-up radio .", "Project Manager: Like a  right , okay .", "Industrial Designer: So you wind up your remote control before you use it .", "Project Manager: How   what kind of  how l long can you get out of that ,", "Industrial Designer: It might", "Project Manager: I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or", "Industrial Designer: You  Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get  when when you got TV .", "Project Manager: That doesn't count though does it ?", "Marketing: Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?", "Project Manager: I thought it was U_V_ like", "Industrial Designer: No .", "Marketing: Artificial light ?", "Industrial Designer: Is it ? Alright i", "Project Manager: Any , any", "Marketing: Has to be solar .", "User Interface: Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or  and dynamo might take more space .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .", "Project Manager: I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights", "Marketing: Mm .

Mm .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Could I just ask  referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging", "Industrial Designer: Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing", "Marketing: or the two things not compatible ?", "Project Manager: Like a dual kind of .", "Industrial Designer: but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they  because , if you lie   on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .", "Marketing: Mm .

Okay .", "Industrial Designer: if you if you wanted to but um the  there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: so that  And then to  uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used .

First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility .
