Ov or can we", "Marketing: Yep .", "Project Manager: No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype .", "Industrial Designer: Well , let's let's  this product .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: And the scroll uh wheel . The solar  not many remotes have the solar , I think .", "Industrial Designer: No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too", "Marketing: Yeah , and uh", "Project Manager: That would have been a thrill .", "Industrial Designer: yes , but", "Marketing: So uh also a uh two ?", "Industrial Designer: I think uh it's a two .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Marketing: Is it easy to use ?", "Project Manager: I'm not sure .  I'm not sure .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "User Interface: Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard  it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it .", "Industrial Designer: Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .", "User Interface: I think  I think a three .", "Industrial Designer: So uh  It's maybe  it's not very uh easy for", "User Interface: Wouldn't give it more .", "Project Manager: Uh I'm doubting  doubting as well . Um", "Marketing: Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .", "Project Manager: Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I   I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: because he is already  he or she is already an advanced user .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: Um  Okay .", "Industrial Designer: After all , I think  personally I would give a two . But", "Project Manager: Uh Roo , a three ?", "User Interface: Yep .", "Project Manager: Ruud ?", "Marketing: Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten .", "Project Manager: So I could make it e easy ?", "User Interface: If you make it a four it will be three in general .", "Industrial Designer: So that's w No , two and a half .", "User Interface: If he makes it a four . Not a three .", "Industrial Designer: Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So", "User Interface: Darn . Nee .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Marketing: Hmm ? Huh ?", "Project Manager: Roo .", "User Interface: A seven , a three   No .", "Marketing: Yeah . I yeah  .", "User Interface: A four and a three together .", "Industrial Designer: Four ?", "User Interface: Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ?", "Marketing: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: Two ?", "Marketing: two , two , three", "Project Manager: No ,", "User Interface: And a three ?", "Project Manager: I haven't said anything yet .", "User Interface: Nee . I know .", "Marketing: No .", "Project Manager: Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten .

If you fill out a four", "Project Manager: But I'm filling in a three .", "Industrial Designer: That's not even", "Project Manager: Does it  will  so it will be a two point five .", "Industrial Designer: But that's not possible to fill in ,", "Project Manager: Yes , it is .", "Industrial Designer: so we have to round it .", "Marketing: Is it easy to find ?", "Project Manager: I have a veto .  Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about  okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely .", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "User Interface: we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .", "Industrial Designer: It it most definitely is  it's very easy .", "Project Manager: Yeah , or beeps or  yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Maybe  Uh I I think I think", "Project Manager: I'm here , I'm here .", "Industrial Designer: something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .", "User Interface: But even without it", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Well , I uh", "Industrial Designer: So , I th", "Project Manager: we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Um Sebastian ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , me too .", "User Interface: Me too .", "Marketing: Yeah , I agree .", "Project Manager: Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh", "Project Manager: it can't be more spongy . So", "Industrial Designer: Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is  um can be  uh how d how do you prono is is moldable .", "User Interface: Was it one of our options ?", "Industrial Designer: No , it's not one of our option ,", "Marketing: No . Uh", "Project Manager: No okay , but but", "User Interface: So , in the in", "Industrial Designer: but when you look in the market , when you look", "Marketing: this this was a most spongy option .", "Project Manager: for the options given , it's the most spongy one .", "Industrial Designer: Uh yes ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics  characteristics with uh market  uh with with the real market .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there .", "Project Manager: They're out there .", "User Interface: But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes , but it's not good enough ,", "Project Manager: I'll give it a one .", "Industrial Designer: so it's a two .", "User Interface: I wan I'll take one .", "Industrial Designer: You take one ? What do you give it ?", "Marketing: Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could", "Project Manager: Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number .", "Marketing: but  yeah .", "Project Manager: Because we need to go on  in  for the time .", "Marketing: Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation .", "User Interface: It will be a one .", "Marketing: So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .", "Industrial Designer: No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four .", "Project Manager: You are", "Project Manager: okay .", "Project Manager: The remote control offers enough features .", "Project Manager: Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?", "Marketing: Well , the basic layout doesn't offem  offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So", "Industrial Designer: Basically it's it's completely programmable .", "Marketing: Yeah , depends .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I know .", "Industrial Designer: So it's quite advanced .", "Project Manager: What what we didn't talk about is um uh", "User Interface: Yeah , but  it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's  If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is  it has all the features um a normal remote has .", "Project Manager: I think it has .", "Marketing: Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat", "Project Manager: Yeah . Bec because you can um  we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So ,", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um   the the signals .", "Industrial Designer: Has uh the signals sent to it .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Signal .", "Project Manager: So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to  as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features .", "Industrial Designer: Absolutely .", "Project Manager: Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . But that  that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: You can use your voice to to programme it . It's", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the  for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .", "User Interface: I'll give a two .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I'll give it a one .", "Marketing: Um I think think a one , 'cause  v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um", "Industrial Designer: Yes . I I've  I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: So high quality , low acceptance .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But  whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is  well , is not sure .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: D do you agree ?", "Industrial Designer: Yes , I agree . I", "Marketing: Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh  function .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Industrial Designer: But   Yes .", "User Interface: But we could  couldn't uh  what what's the selling price ? Fifty ?", "Project Manager: Twenty five Euros .", "User Interface: Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: But even now , if only our production costs w  uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was  were t uh was twenty two ?", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: So uh  selling price uh would be uh", "Industrial Designer: M about fifty Euros .", "User Interface: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: That's quite ex", "User Interface: That's price , but w w", "Industrial Designer: well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .", "User Interface: No . An original remote control of any TV kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh", "Industrial Designer: Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .", "User Interface: Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .", "Project Manager: Bu but  well  yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition", "Project Manager: .", "Industrial Designer: and this one does .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So I think it's worth its price .", "Project Manager: Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um", "Marketing: Yeah , but uh  with these ratings uh", "Project Manager: That's counting .", "Industrial Designer: Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .", "Marketing: should be about one point s seven ,", "User Interface: Four six seven eight .", "Marketing: yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Nine divided by six .", "Project Manager: Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um  What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ?", "Project Manager: Try to translate that .", "Industrial Designer: Well", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Any any other  Uh , Roo ?", "User Interface: Yeah , I think uh", "Industrial Designer: Well , I think", "Marketing: Ye", "Project Manager: Roo .", "User Interface: The process was good .", "User Interface: But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made", "Industrial Designer: Mm . Actually , we had", "User Interface: the the choice between  what", "Project Manager: Better decision .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "User Interface: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: We had we had too little information actually .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So  And uh um the the the  well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too  the the choice of components was way too narrow .", "Project Manager: Less . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So there was not really a process of uh", "Project Manager: So we could we we could be  we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .", "Industrial Designer: Well  Yes .", "Marketing: The prices .", "Industrial Designer: Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: We we thought of possibilities  who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . So", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: We're tempered by that , yes .", "Project Manager: Okay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ?", "User Interface: No , no .", "Project Manager: Ruud ?", "Marketing: I agree .", "Project Manager: You agree , okay . Uh leadership .", "User Interface: Fantastic .", "Project Manager: Okay , Roo's on for his promotion .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,  okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: I think we're a good team .", "Project Manager: I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh  .  Um", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed .", "Project Manager: Yeah .  So um", "Project Manager: Yeah , but but si uh w w w   when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well .", "Industrial Designer: I think so too .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Um", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ?", "Industrial Designer: Uh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Because of the response", "Industrial Designer: It  it's", "Project Manager: or", "User Interface: Response", "Industrial Designer: The response is very slow", "User Interface: and", "Industrial Designer: and the possibilities are very limited .

It's uh  the drawing on on the b on the board is  r right from the pen .", "Project Manager: Okay , so", "User Interface: So uh", "Project Manager: it it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ?", "User Interface: You to take in account that your  you m", "Project Manager: Uh yeah .", "User Interface: yeah uh", "Industrial Designer: Maybe it's  it needs to be calibrateds .", "User Interface: It's too slow", "Project Manager: It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting .", "Industrial Designer: It is ?", "Project Manager: So uh it's not the calibration ,", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: it's the thing itself , I think .", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ?", "Marketing: No .", "Project Manager: Not at all .", "Marketing: Not really .", "Project Manager: Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing ,", "Industrial Designer: I I think so too .", "Project Manager: although I would like to see um O_C_R_ .", "User Interface: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes .", "User Interface: If it has O_C_R_  , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: It w it w yeah . It was necessary for me to uh", "Project Manager: To digitise them .", "User Interface: Yeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: I type faster than I write .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So", "Industrial Designer: But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy  it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I think it's a good product .
