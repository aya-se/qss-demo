    "Project Manager: Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um  .",
    "Project Manager: Alright we're moving on to conceptual design .",
    "User Interface: 'Scuse me .",
    "Marketing: Bless you .",
    "Project Manager: Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um ,  under marketing we targeted our audience , and  Um , yeah . That was  generally   how helpful that was .",
    "Project Manager: Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're  Right , um  So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what  where you've come from our last time . Does everyone have presentations ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Hmm .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes .",
    "User Interface: Yes .",
    "Project Manager: Would anybody like to go first ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Sure .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .",
    "Project Manager: And why not wood ?",
    "Industrial Designer: And ,",
    "Project Manager: And why not wood ?",
    "Industrial Designer: hmm ?  Uh , well we can use wood .  I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . So that's what I've got on design .",
    "Project Manager: 'S good .",
    "Marketing: Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material",
    "Project Manager: Hmm .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: which is quite shocking .",
    "Marketing: Ha . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the  is the current trend",
    "Marketing: and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . For fashion , we go for fashion .",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "Marketing: The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to  I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables ,",
    "Marketing: but that's just a personal opinion .",
    "Marketing: I think",
    "Marketing: I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room .",
    "Marketing: Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?",
    "Marketing: Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find  come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Marketing: Thank you for your attention .",
    "User Interface: So .",
    "Project Manager: I think it's the next  it's the blue one , yeah .",
    "User Interface: Oh , uh , there we go .  Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh .",
    "User Interface: I actually wasn't aware of the  new trends in electronics",
    "User Interface: and and uh",
    "Marketing: Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um  fabrics .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control .",
    "User Interface: So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh  Okay , alright anyway . Um  here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying  we're gonna try to talk about , um  what kind of uh  how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .",
    "User Interface: And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system .  Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of  I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?",
    "Project Manager: Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time .",
    "User Interface: 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this  it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um  the wheel",
    "Project Manager: You need a screen for it ?",
    "User Interface: you  it seems like you would need a screen .",
    "Industrial Designer: You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With TV channels it's , you know , one two three . So",
    "User Interface: But like if you think about it  yeah but if  so is it just  okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ?",
    "Project Manager: We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ ,",
    "User Interface: Are we",
    "Project Manager: that was one of th I I was",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: sorry ,",
    "Project Manager: I I meant to update you on that . Um .",
    "User Interface: Alright . Okay .",
    "Marketing: But the screen can come up on the telly , the  she said .",
    "User Interface: Okay . Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: That correct ?",
    "User Interface: So anyway if  well we just  we need to  Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen  I think  I was thinking  okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna  I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a  right .",
    "Marketing: Graphical interface ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah like you're g",
    "Marketing: Uh on the  you can have it on the telly though .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can  okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: So that    people seems to be  well",
    "Project Manager: You've  Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to",
    "User Interface: You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um  I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because  So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if  or or  then again if you just  I guess  I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the TV like what channel you're on .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or",
    "Marketing: Yeah , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: But but imagine someone with s",
    "Industrial Designer: My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the TV .",
    "User Interface: I oh yeah ?",
    "Project Manager: But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to",
    "User Interface: 'Cause you'll have to like",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: They have to r wheel really fast .",
    "User Interface: but you can quickly s you can",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: at least on theirs .",
    "User Interface: Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be  you  I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um  So you're either  you're  you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like  from five to six you could tap or someth",
    "Project Manager: Right .",
    "User Interface: And then there's also the concern about you know um  how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um  you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd   uh  I'd think that the screen would be better ,",
    "User Interface: like",
    "Project Manager: because you could have that menu option , sort of",
    "User Interface: I would think so too , like  So I mean  and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: but then again it would  it does make kind of  if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: It's more expensive according to the design people .",
    "User Interface: m yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Uh .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , that's the only thing though .",
    "Industrial Designer: You have to get a  an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "User Interface: You can get to  you know , you can  Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can  it brings up like the menu on the TV",
    "Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: So the TV is the screen , that  yeah",
    "User Interface: yeah , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: So it would have all these different options of changing",
    "User Interface: Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .",
    "Project Manager: to",
    "Marketing: Look it even has settings .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Hmm ?",
    "Marketing: On the",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: you can just take theirs and just",
    "User Interface: Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: but um  'cause that just  it does seem like , it  that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but  I dunno , and then  so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .",
    "User Interface: So",
    "Project Manager: Um , right . What if  I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing ,",
    "Project Manager: or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or",
    "User Interface: It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the TV .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah definitely .",
    "Project Manager: okay .",
    "User Interface: Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: I mean it it needs to be easy to",
    "Marketing: Yeah but should be comfortable .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: I mean how do how do  I'm not really  Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So",
    "Marketing: Yeah I use it like that .",
    "Industrial Designer: W when we had the wheely remote control , we  it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: But , were there buttons on there as well ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah , so",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do .",
    "Project Manager: Mm . Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: So we just used the top part .",
    "User Interface: Mm yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , so  but I mean I think it could be pretty small .",
    "Marketing: Uh .",
    "User Interface: Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can",
    "Project Manager: What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you  so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .",
    "User Interface: But can't you just get",
    "Project Manager: Do  do you know what I'm talking about though ? Like , uh , yeah just something",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of",
    "User Interface: K",
    "Marketing: Well you can have it on the settings ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah .",
    "Marketing: no ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know  if  so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the TV screen .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: is is  if w I",
    "User Interface: That keeps it",
    "Project Manager: if we can do this , that'd probably be",
    "User Interface: really  Yeah . Uh you wouldn't  I don't  I just don't think you would even need it .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , yeah .",
    "User Interface: So",
    "Project Manager: So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this  how they actually programme these things , and if that's",
    "User Interface: Mean",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh how they make the menu show up on the TV ?",
    "Project Manager: yeah . I mean it  would y would  that would be",
    "Industrial Designer: I don't know .",
    "User Interface: I mean you can do it ,",
    "Marketing: They already do it .",
    "Industrial Designer: I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the TV , not inside the remote .",
    "User Interface: you  it's  it doesn't seem that hard . I mean I've never bought a remote .",
    "Industrial Designer: I'm not sure .",
    "User Interface: It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Well they usually are .",
    "User Interface: which is a little",
    "Industrial Designer: Well",
    "User Interface: My  I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know .",
    "Marketing: No .",
    "Project Manager: Huh .",
    "User Interface: But um",
    "Industrial Designer: I guess that's right . It always comes with the TV .",
    "User Interface: So , um  but I mean it's  I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it  most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Well so  So , do we need  I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about  But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay .",
    "User Interface: That's what it does anyway .",
    "Marketing: But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you  like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like",
    "Marketing: and I never get it .",
    "Project Manager: yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Never ever .",
    "User Interface: So , but",
    "Marketing: So",
    "User Interface: oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ?",
    "Marketing: Well on the telly .",
    "Industrial Designer: Or on the TV too .",
    "User Interface: On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea",
    "User Interface: because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those  like okay now I hit this  you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .",
    "Project Manager: Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way ,",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Project Manager: so that fits with the",
    "User Interface: Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are  really hot right now , so",
    "Project Manager: B Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Did you did you get that pc picture on  did they provide you with that picture on the web ?",
    "User Interface: Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so",
    "Marketing: That's quite interesting . What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ?",
    "Project Manager: Oh god .",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh , I was gonna say .",
    "User Interface: Oh .",
    "Industrial Designer: You said uh people want spongy .",
    "Industrial Designer: Um , one of your",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's  in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy .",
    "User Interface: Oh , okay , that would be cool .",
    "Project Manager: Ah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Mm .",
    "Marketing: Just nice feel , but I hate spongy .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of  oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . I mean definitely the area round it .",
    "User Interface: But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda",
    "User Interface: so you're like",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah I think it could work .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Or what if we integrated the  the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables",
    "User Interface: we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like",
    "Industrial Designer: Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana .",
    "User Interface: a vegetable .",
    "Marketing: Well it could be like mobiles that just  you just put a cover .",
    "Project Manager: An orange .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana ,",
    "Marketing: which frankly I'm not particularly fond of ,",
    "Marketing: um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: You know you had  there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .",
    "Industrial Designer: You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: And it could  the colour can fit your sitting room ,",
    "Marketing: so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have  well I don't know . Um .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: So what if  what",
    "User Interface: So I think",
    "Project Manager: this is",
    "User Interface: yeah , colours .",
    "Project Manager: I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there .",
    "Project Manager: Is that kind of",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: I  'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Um",
    "User Interface: Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables .",
    "User Interface: I do I dunno . Um",
    "Project Manager: I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just  the feedback we've just got about the",
    "Marketing: Maybe a ball .",
    "Project Manager: A ball ?",
    "Marketing: Know , a squashy ball .",
    "Marketing: A relaxing squashy ball .   That you can p",
    "User Interface: That's in the shape of a fruit , like a",
    "Marketing: well I  see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: and I'm thinking how do you change the hard  would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a",
    "Project Manager: This is just  Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy .",
    "Marketing: Oh , okay , yeah . Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for",
    "Project Manager: That  see I was thinking this s",
    "Marketing: Which is cheaper .",
    "Project Manager: sorry",
    "Marketing: Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually .",
    "Project Manager: I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing .",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh . Mm .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: And like this  you could have like you could have like cherries and  things around there .",
    "User Interface: Oh I like that shape .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Um but",
    "Industrial Designer: I was thinking sort of a single ball shape .",
    "Project Manager: I was thinking if it was like this",
    "User Interface: Yeah  .",
    "Industrial Designer: So you're holding a squishy ball",
    "Project Manager: 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy",
    "Industrial Designer: and then it has a  Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: It's like it has to be s",
    "Project Manager: It's almost like your thumb is farther up ,",
    "User Interface: yeah  .",
    "Project Manager: so if if you could squish it lower then",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah I guess so .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either  like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah .",
    "User Interface: What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can  so so maybe one you know  you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing",
    "User Interface: and you could get  you could have your choice , you know ?",
    "Marketing: Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover .",
    "Marketing: But  well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "Marketing: and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: and",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: No .",
    "User Interface: Oh .",
    "Marketing: Um . That's nicer . I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Hmm . Well that's not very neat , but",
    "Marketing: Um .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . I mean I think uh  and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely  So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part .",
    "Marketing: If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your  to the way you hold it .",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah you could squish it .",
    "Marketing: If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you  it it just moulds to your hand .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ?",
    "Industrial Designer: I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath .",
    "User Interface: Fruits and veg .",
    "Marketing: We we don't know .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: And the rest is the company  the company colour's silver ?",
    "Project Manager: It was , yeah , silver and yellow . It l it looks like   I don't",
    "User Interface: We could promote the banana one .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Like  mm .",
    "Project Manager: I mean that's another question , where are we gonna  we we should have the logo somewhere on it .",
    "User Interface: Mm .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm . Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case .",
    "User Interface: Oh yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , th and that would  that",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits .",
    "User Interface: But uh it",
    "Industrial Designer: Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: No but it does it automatically .",
    "Marketing: Does it automatically ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: I don't know .",
    "Project Manager: I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me .",
    "Project Manager: But if someone",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark .",
    "Industrial Designer: That was me .",
    "Project Manager: Was that you ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo ,",
    "Industrial Designer: which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches .",
    "Marketing: Oh , a dynamo is  ah ,  it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself .",
    "Industrial Designer: So I sort of picked battery .",
    "Marketing: It's quite sweet .",
    "Industrial Designer: We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .",
    "Project Manager: I think batteries sound good .",
    "Industrial Designer: It  it seems a little weird for a living room anyways .",
    "Project Manager: What does everyone else think ?",
    "User Interface: The dynamo would be interesting  .",
    "Marketing: No . But dynamo  the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it  creates energy on its own .",
    "Project Manager: What about Kryptonite ?",
    "User Interface: Oh .",
    "Marketing: Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Don't know the cost .",
    "Industrial Designer: Didn't have enough data to actually",
    "Marketing: Does anyone have costs on the on the web ?",
    "Industrial Designer: All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost .",
    "Marketing: Okay . Right .",
    "User Interface: Hmm .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem . Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .",
    "Project Manager: What does chip on print mean ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip ,",
    "Project Manager: Uh-huh .",
    "Industrial Designer: calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip .",
    "Project Manager: Right . So , chip on print is just  means like that they're mass-produced .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Case is what we were discussing yeah .",
    "Project Manager: yeah . Casing . Yeah .  thinking of like syntactic case and thi",
    "Project Manager: um  let's see . Is there anything else we need to",
    "User Interface: Hmm .",
    "Project Manager: talk about ? Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough .",
    "Project Manager: Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach .",
    "Marketing: Oh , thank you .",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "User Interface: Cool .",
    "Project Manager: See you soon . Does it matter that I end early ?",
    "Marketing: I  it's strange because",
    "Project Manager: How how early is it ? I didn't get a pop-up thing that said"
