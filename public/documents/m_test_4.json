And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to \" Session \" , and write MR eleven .", "Professor E: Yeah . Yeah . We didn't have a front - end meeting today .", "Grad C: And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's  gets marked as unread , unused .", "Professor E: OK .", "PhD A: MR eleven .", "Grad C: MR eleven .", "Postdoc F: That sounds like a spy code .", "Professor E: Mmm . OK . So .", "Grad C: There 's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work  correctly .", "Professor E: Agenda . Any agenda items today ?", "Grad C: I wanna talk a little bit about getting  how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to  how to finish it up .", "Professor E: OK .", "Postdoc F: I wanna ask about um , some aud audio monitoring on some of the  um  well some of the equipment . In particular , the  well uh , that 's just what I wanna ask .", "Professor E: OK audio monitoring , Jane .", "Postdoc F: Ba - based on some of the tran uh  i In listening to  some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact  in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of  of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings ,", "Grad C: Oh really .", "Postdoc F: so I", "PhD B: \" Spikes \" , you mean like uh , instantaneous click type spikes , or  ?", "Postdoc F: Mm - hmm . Yeah .", "PhD A: Spikes ?", "Grad C: Clicks .", "Postdoc F: Yeah .", "Professor E: Hmm .", "Postdoc F: Yeah .", "PhD B: Huh .", "Postdoc F: And I don't know what the e electronics is but .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Postdoc F: Yeah .", "Grad C: Well , I think it 's", "PhD A: Touching .", "Grad C: uh , it  it could be a number of things .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Grad C: It could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could  the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . It might be a connector .", "Postdoc F: Oh , OK . Well maybe  Then we don't really have to talk about that as an", "PhD B: You could try an experiment and say \" OK , I 'm about to test for spikes \" ,", "Postdoc F: I  I take that off the agenda .", "PhD B: and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you .", "Grad C: Yeah . Right .", "PhD B: \" Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . \"", "Postdoc F: Oh that", "Professor E: Um .", "Postdoc F: Well , OK .", "PhD B: No I 'm just", "Professor E: I mean , were this a professional audio recording ,  what we would do   what you would do is  in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that  that  that things are not giving that kind of performance . And if they are , then they can't be used .", "Grad C: Right .", "Professor E: So . Um . Let 's see . I guess  I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus .", "Postdoc F: Good .", "Professor E: And then um , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , uh , agendas . So maybe I 'll  I 'll start with that actually . Uh , um .  Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about  discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and  And I think part of  part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the  because of uh the fact that the meetings are  are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing", "Grad C: Mmm .", "Professor E: and  and I 'm sure help out his own time . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's  he 's  So , uh in order  I 'd  I think that this is a wish on his part . Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and  and", "Grad C: Right .", "Professor E: But um , we could try anyway , uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , uh , say the day before .", "Grad C: Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to  like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor E: OK . You  you wanna volunteer to do that ?", "Grad C: Sure .", "Professor E: OK . Alright so we 'll send out agenda request .", "Grad C: Let me", "Professor E: Uh .", "PhD B: That 'll be  I think that 'll help", "Grad C: I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not  get done .", "PhD B: That 'll help a lot , actually .", "Professor E: Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh  for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . But  but   But . Uh .  But we can try . Maybe it 'll work .", "PhD B: Mmm .", "Grad C: Yeah . Maybe . Weirder things have happened .", "Professor E: Yeah .", "Postdoc F: I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , I mean . Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more .", "PhD B: I would  I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him .", "Grad C: Well then", "Professor E: Yeah . Actually it  This  this maybe brings up another topic which is um  So we 're done with that topic . The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that .", "Grad C: Yeah , actually I  I was going to say we need to  talk about that too .", "Professor E: Yeah . Why  why don't we do that .", "Grad C: OK . Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . Um .  And they are being assembled as we speak , I hope . And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . Um , and then the other question I was thinking about is  well , a couple things . First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in ,", "Grad C: and get people 's opinions on  on what they think of them . Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless . Another wireless setup . I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be  better than the wired .", "Professor E: So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ?", "Grad C: Um , well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes .", "Professor E: So , um .", "Grad C: And  So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six .", "Professor E: So let 's see we", "Grad C: Right ? So we could have up to nine .", "Professor E: And right now we can have up to six .", "Grad C: Right . And we have five , we 're getting one more .", "Professor E: Yeah .", "Grad C: And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel .", "Professor E: Oh . So yeah so the only  Beyond the mike  the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars .", "Grad C: Right .", "Professor E: Oh , we should do it .", "Grad C: OK . OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and  and then just go ahead and order them .", "Professor E: Yeah . Yeah .", "PhD B: I don't quite understand how that  how that works , . If  So we 're not increasing the number of channels . OK .", "Grad C: No , we 're just replacing the wired  the two wired that are still working ,", "PhD B: OK . I see .", "Grad C: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless .", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD B: Three wireds work ,", "Professor E: Basically we found", "PhD B: right ?", "Grad C: I  I guess three wireds work , yeah .", "PhD B: Yeah . Yeah .", "Professor E: Yeah . But we 've had more problems with that .", "Grad C: Yep .", "Professor E: And that sort of bypasses the whole  the whole Jimbox thing and all that .", "Grad C: Right .", "Professor E: And so um , we  we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries .", "Grad C: Right .", "Professor E: That seems to be the key issue .", "Grad C: Everyone 's battery OK ?", "PhD B: I checked them this morning , they should be .", "Grad C: OK .", "Professor E: Yeah . Um ,  That 's the only thing with them . But the quality seems really good and  Um I heard from UW that they 're  they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . They 're  they 're  they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf .", "Grad C: Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone  on the same page with that .", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD B: SRI , really ?", "Grad C: Yeah .", "PhD B: Oh .", "Grad C: They got sa apparent Well , Maybe  this needs to be bleeped out ? I have no clue .", "Professor E: Uh , I don't know .", "Grad C: I don't know how much of it 's public .", "Professor E: Probably we shouldn't  probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff .", "Grad C: Right .", "Professor E: Yeah . But anyway there 's  there 's  there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and  and uh  and NIST and UW . So . Um . But  but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is  is quite positive with the Sony ,", "Grad C: Right .", "Professor E: uh , radio - mikes . Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ?", "Grad C: Uh , no , we 're having the  them do it .", "Professor E: No ?", "Grad C: So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it .", "Professor E: Oh .", "Grad C: So , they  they charge", "Professor E: OK . Nothing against you and your hand - soldering", "Grad C: right .", "Professor E: but", "Grad C: You 've never seen my hand - soldering . But uh , a as I said they 're coming in .", "Professor E: Uh , OK , so that 's being done professionally and", "Grad C: I  I mean", "Professor E: Yeah .", "Grad C: Yeah . I mean .", "Professor E: Yeah .", "Grad C: As professionally as I guess you can get it done .", "Professor E: Well , it could  if they do a lot of it , it 's", "Grad C: I mean i it 's just their repair shop . Right ? Their maintenance people .", "Professor E: Well , we 'll see what it  it 's like .", "Grad C: Yep .", "Professor E: That  tha that can be quite good . Th - this  Yeah , OK . Good . Yeah . So let 's go with that .", "Grad C: And , I mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like .", "Professor E: Uh , Yeah . So , um , uh , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . Uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . I guess  Was  the decision last time was that the  the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? Has that started , or is that  ?", "Postdoc F: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that .", "Grad C: Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . So I did the  all that last week . So all the  all the forms are now  on the computer . And uh , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh  transcribers use different tools . And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those .", "Postdoc F: Mm - hmm . So he has a nice set up that they  it w it will be efficient for them to do that .", "Professor E: OK .", "Grad C: I  I don't think it 'll take too long .", "Professor E: So anyway", "Grad C: So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect .", "Professor E: So anyway I think we  we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave .", "Grad C: Right . I 've already done five or six  sets .", "Postdoc F: OK .", "Grad C: So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also .", "Professor E: Yeah , he might  he might be asking  Right . OK . Uh , is Dave  I don't know if Dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings , uh if he knows .", "Postdoc F: I don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even .", "PhD A: No , no .", "Grad C: Uh , we don't have a active one but I 'll make sure he 's on the list .", "Postdoc F: Yeah . Should we call him ? I mean is he  d is he definitely not available today ?", "Professor E: I don't know .", "Postdoc F: Should I call his office and see ?", "PhD A: He was in .", "Grad C: I mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts .", "Professor E: Uh , well i it 's uh", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD A: Yeah , he was in  s", "Postdoc F: He wasn't there at cof", "Professor E: Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor E: Yeah .", "Postdoc F: OK .", "Professor E: OK . Uh , so .", "Grad C: Yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like  Tuesdays and Thursdays ?", "PhD A: I think he has a class . Yeah .", "PhD B: Yeah . He might have .", "Grad C: Oh well , whatever .", "Grad D: You talking about David Gelbart ?", "Professor E: Oh , OK .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "PhD B: Yeah .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Professor E: Yeah .", "Postdoc F: Yes .", "Grad D: Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now .", "PhD B: Yeah .", "Grad D: So .", "Professor E: Yeah .", "Postdoc F: OK .", "Professor E: OK . So , that 's why we 're not seeing him . OK . Uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on .", "Postdoc F: OK .", "Professor E: And the  and the recordings also ,", "Postdoc F: Um", "Professor E: just where we are . Yeah .", "Postdoc F: Well , so um , should we  we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or  ?", "Grad C: Well , we have about thirty - two hours uh as of , I guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours .", "Professor E: And  and that 's  that 's uh  How much of that is digits ? It 's uh  that 's including digits ,", "Grad C: That 's including digits .", "Professor E: right ?", "Grad C: I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits .", "Professor E: So  Yeah . So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of  There 's got to be more than thirty hour", "PhD A: Mmm .", "Grad C: Of  of non - digits ?", "Professor E: i it couldn't  of  Of non - digits .", "Grad C: Yeah , absolutely . I mean , the digits don't take up that much time .", "Professor E: Yeah , yeah . OK .", "Postdoc F: OK , and the transcribers h I , uh , don't have the exact numbers , but I  think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . The next step is to  that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um  in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . Um , for example , i they 'll say uh \" ninety - two \" . And you know , so how  you could", "Grad C: Nine two ,", "Postdoc F: e Exactly .", "Grad C: right .", "Postdoc F: So if you just say \" nine two \" , the  there are many s ways that could have been expressed . An - and I just had them  I  I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things .", "PhD B: You know , Jane ?", "Grad C: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: Um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in  in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them ,  a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of  inconsistencies and mis", "Grad C: Misspelled .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Postdoc F: You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . Y you mean just uh  on each  on each line there 's a one word right ? It 's one token from the  from the corpus .", "PhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .", "Postdoc F: Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I  I agree that 's a very good use of it .", "PhD B: Oh so you already have that , OK .", "Postdoc F: Well that 's  that 's a way  that 's  You know , the spell - check basically does that but  but in addition  yes , that 's  that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon .", "PhD B: Mm - hmm . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh ,", "Postdoc F: Exactly . And then you ca then you can do a s", "PhD A: Yeah .", "PhD B: i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and  and so it makes it easier .", "Postdoc F: Absolutely . I agree . That 's a very good  that 's a very good uh , suggestion . And that was  that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . I didn't get to that point but  So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then um , there 's a  he she wants the uh , actually a  an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either \" VOC \" for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , \" NONVOC \" for door - slam , and \" GLOSS \" for things that have to do with  if they said a s a spoken form with this  m this pronunciation error .", "Grad C: Right .", "Postdoc F: I already had that convention", "PhD B: Oh that 's great .", "Postdoc F: but I  I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most  ha most efficiently handled by uh  by a  a filter . That was what I was always planing on . So that , you know you get a whole long list  exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say \" curly bracket laugh curly bracket \" ,", "PhD B: Mm - hmm .", "Postdoc F: then y you know it 's  it 's  You  you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space ,", "PhD B: Yeah .", "Postdoc F: so man So many ways that error prone .", "PhD B: Right . Right .", "Postdoc F: So , um ,  um I 'm  I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments , and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying ,", "PhD B: Mm - hmm .", "Postdoc F: you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens", "PhD B: Mm - hmm .", "Postdoc F: and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes .

Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh  the you know ,  uh enumerated , or i", "Grad C: Mm - hmm .", "Postdoc F: it 's not a good way of saying  but it 's  it 's the  specific uh way of stating these  these letters .", "Grad C: Right . So it sounds good .", "Postdoc F: And so anyway , the clean  those are those things and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format .

Good .", "Postdoc F: and I went through it last night , it 's  it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word .

And it works quite well . But , not always .", "Professor E: Uh - huh . Uh - huh .", "PhD A: So .", "Professor E: OK .", "Grad C: Good .", "Professor E: Um , let 's see . I think the uh  Were  were you basically done with the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh  bleep editing .", "Grad C: Right . So the  The idea is that we need to have  We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece  pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password ,", "Professor E: Yeah .", "Grad C: a single password . Each person will have a single password , user name and password . And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . And that way each person only has to remember one password .", "Professor E: I  I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . I mean if people have  Uh , I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . And then  um  if I thought it was OK , I 'd say \" it 's OK \" .", "Grad C: Mm - hmm .", "Professor E: And , I  uh  I mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare .", "Grad C: Right , I mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for  other reasons .", "Professor E: OK .", "Grad C: And so that  that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people  you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um  I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just uh , tell them , \" here 's the web page \" , um , \" you need a password \" . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it .", "Professor E: That 's  I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say  \" here is a  here is  \" I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but  but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , \" here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK \" .", "Grad C: I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide .", "Professor E: And then they 'd hand it back to you .", "Grad C: But certainly I wouldn't want a printout . These are big , and I would much rather be  ha be able to just sit and leaf through it .", "Professor E: You find it easier to go through a large  I mean how do you read books ?", "Grad C: Well I certainly read books by hand . But for something like this , I think it 's easier to do it on the web .", "Professor E: Really ? I mean , it", "Grad C: Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I  I 'm  I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these . I wanna just be able to go to  go to the web site  and visit it as I want .", "Professor E: Going to a web site is easy , but flipping through a hundred pounds  a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web .", "Grad C: Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper . So .", "Professor E: Really ?", "Postdoc F: I have one question . So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? Because I  I do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the", "Professor E: So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong ,", "Postdoc F: Yeah .", "Professor E: but the way I imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gonna go \" oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the  where 's the release ? \" And then there 'll be a subset of people , right ?  OK there 's  I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor E: OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh \" well , yeah , I really would like to see that . \" And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document , I mean unless you 're searching . Searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not  so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that ,", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor E: but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . Um if  if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out . I mean , so it 's  it 's  I mean , you  you 're  you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where  where I  I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go \" hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , \" and then that group would need it  S It seems like i if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy ,", "Grad C: Well , no fre for the most", "Professor E: we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people", "Grad C: For the most frequent case they just say  \" it 's OK \" and then they 're done . And I think  almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method .", "Professor E: Mm - hmm .", "Postdoc F: The other thing too is it seems like", "Professor E: Um , yeah , that 's true .", "Postdoc F: Go ahead .", "Grad C: I mean , cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor E: I guess  Yeah , I guess we don't need their signature . I guess an email OK is alright .", "Grad C: Oh that was another thing I  I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it  that an email approval was sufficient . But  I don't actually know .", "PhD B: Are  are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ?", "Grad C: Yes . If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I  I  I think they should be allowed to do that .", "Postdoc F: I also  mm - hmm .", "PhD B: So that means other people are editing what you say ?", "Professor E: Uh  I don't know about that .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "PhD B: I don't know if I like that .", "Grad C: Well , the only other choice is that the person would say \" no , don't distribute this meeting at all \" , and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say \" don't distribute it at all \" .", "Professor E: But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice .", "Grad C: Well , but if  if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient .", "Professor E: Right ? Yeah . Yeah , but that 's our decision then . Right ?", "Grad C: Um , I don't think so . I mean , because if I object to the conversation .", "Professor E: I think it is .", "Grad C: If I say \" we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , \" and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side .", "Postdoc F: The  I agree that the consent forms were  uh , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that  um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them .", "Professor E: I see . OK , well , if that 's what it said .", "Postdoc F: And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that  uh , we wouldn't want someone to say \" oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but  it was too hard to access \" . So I think it 's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it . Now  in terms of like editing it by hand , I mean I think it 's  i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited . But  but it seems to me that sometimes um , you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice  it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK .", "Grad C: I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it . Um .", "Professor E: Um  I mean it 's also a mixture of people , I mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not .", "Grad C: Yep .", "Professor E: Others would consider it  this uh  a  a set of skills that they would have to gain . You know ?", "Grad C: Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former .", "Professor E: It depends on what meetings .", "Postdoc F: That 's true .", "PhD B: So far .", "Grad C: So .", "Professor E: In the meetings so far , yeah .", "Grad C: Yep .", "Professor E: But we 're trying to expand this , right ?", "Grad C: Right .", "Professor E: So I  I  I actually think that paper is the more universal thing .", "Grad C: And that  Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright .", "Postdoc F: Mm - hmm . Yeah .", "Grad C: I think everyone in the meeting can access the web .", "Professor E: No , I think we have to be able to print it out . It 's not just if they want to print it out .

For security ?", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Postdoc F: Yeah , OK good .", "Professor E: Right .", "Grad C: Um .

I", "Professor E: Certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient .", "Grad C: Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what  the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them .", "Professor E: I 'm just wondering about", "Postdoc F: You could mail it to them .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Postdoc F: Get an a mailing address .", "Grad C: Equivalent .", "PhD A: But", "Postdoc F: But I think it 's easier to drop in the box .", "PhD A: Just put the button on  on the web page which say \" please send me the  the scripts \" .", "Grad C: That 's right .", "Postdoc F: Oh that 's interesting .", "PhD A: Yeah .", "PhD B: What um  When you display it on the web page , what are  what are you showing them ? Utterances , or  ?", "Grad C: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: And so can they bleep within an utterance ?", "Grad C: No . Whole utterances only .", "PhD B: Whole utterances .", "Grad C: And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's uh , uh it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level . Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand .", "Professor E: There 's another aspect to this which maybe  is part of why this is bothering me . Um , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this .", "PhD B: Mmm .", "Grad C: I mean that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient .", "Professor E: I  I  I understand .", "PhD B: I know where you 're going .", "Professor E: I think that 's the bad idea .", "Grad C: Oh .", "Professor E: See because you 're gon you 're  uh  Really .
