    "Project Manager: Welcome back .",
    "User Interface: Hello .",
    "Marketing: Hello .",
    "Project Manager: Uh let me see .",
    "User Interface: There's one of mine .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . Roo , welcome back .",
    "User Interface: Hello , Flores .",
    "Project Manager: The waiting is for Sebastian .",
    "User Interface: .",
    "Project Manager: There he is .",
    "Industrial Designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ?",
    "User Interface: We have a slight problem .  I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys .",
    "Project Manager: Sorry ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ?",
    "Project Manager: Uh no . You can't ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: sorry .",
    "User Interface: So just cancel it .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well , during my work I have no time either .",
    "Project Manager: Well ,",
    "Industrial Designer: So",
    "Project Manager: this is life .  Sorry uh , Roo .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box .  Accidentally .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting .",
    "User Interface: But it's alright .",
    "Project Manager: Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ?",
    "Industrial Designer: I think so too .",
    "Project Manager: Roo ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Ruud ?",
    "Marketing: Almost .",
    "Project Manager: Almost , okay .",
    "Project Manager: Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m",
    "User Interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe .",
    "Project Manager: Um we will figure that out . Ca  can you try to",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Marketing: Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the  .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , w we will see .",
    "User Interface: I don't think it's wireless here .",
    "Project Manager: Um  it is , yeah . Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: It is .",
    "User Interface: Or it is . Yeah ?",
    "Industrial Designer: It is .",
    "User Interface: Okay , great .",
    "Marketing: Uh okay .",
    "Project Manager: Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um  we have forty minutes . So it's now  Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .  It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: uh uh  we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with .",
    "User Interface: Time , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty ,  which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um  then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .",
    "User Interface: Yes .",
    "Project Manager: Is that clear ? Any questions on these requirements ? No ?  Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah , I'll start .",
    "Project Manager: Uh uh yeah . Okay ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes .",
    "Project Manager: great .",
    "User Interface: Um  Oh , how can I uh  Geez , and sli and show . Um  Just uh press it .",
    "User Interface: Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .  Uh the method of the remote control is just  the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Um but um  yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh  the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh  it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than  less than forty years old .",
    "Project Manager: Uh-huh .",
    "User Interface: So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my  in  my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , uh b uh most .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , so",
    "Project Manager: the important thing here is",
    "User Interface: And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .",
    "Marketing: Oh , user-friendly .",
    "Project Manager: In the market , yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh",
    "User Interface: Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . Sebastian .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .  Excuse me .",
    "User Interface: Scusi .",
    "Industrial Designer: Um  Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .",
    "Industrial Designer: Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a TV set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a TV set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,",
    "User Interface: Energies and uh",
    "Industrial Designer: but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?",
    "Project Manager: No , it's not visible .",
    "Industrial Designer: No ? Well  Um , there's a energy source here .  And um basically there  it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look .  Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that .  It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every TV set is controlled infrared .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w",
    "User Interface: The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .",
    "Industrial Designer: yes . In the  and it's a little more  a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .  So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .",
    "Project Manager: So it's fairly easy .",
    "Industrial Designer: There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before ,",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Succeed in it also .",
    "Industrial Designer: and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .",
    "Project Manager: Okay ,",
    "Industrial Designer: So   Okay , so uh",
    "Project Manager: good .",
    "Industrial Designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every TV set . So I think that uh should be clear .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .",
    "User Interface: And what's the um",
    "Industrial Designer: I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .",
    "User Interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or",
    "Industrial Designer: No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: So we can use them . So that's no problem .",
    "User Interface: For the same costs , it's can be uh in our",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making",
    "User Interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh",
    "Industrial Designer: We can we can make its I think .",
    "Marketing: Well you could only lit uh the buttons  the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .",
    "Marketing: Or",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "User Interface: But I think",
    "Industrial Designer: Hmm .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,",
    "Marketing: Hmm , true .",
    "User Interface: and not for",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes . Well , it's not one light , it  there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .",
    "Industrial Designer: No no no , no . That's right , that's right .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: So  well , this uh should be it .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Um have a think about it .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , Ruud .",
    "Marketing: Oh , mine is already outdated .",
    "Project Manager: Okay well ,",
    "Project Manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .",
    "Marketing: Since uh",
    "Project Manager: So any income is welcome .  Input .",
    "Marketing: Okay , make  Well  Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of   of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Could you step a little bit more to the right ?  Yeah , thank you .",
    "Marketing: But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .",
    "Marketing: Uh well , skip this .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Well , it's  this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the  about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm .",
    "Marketing: So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . Well , that's interesting .",
    "Marketing: Or",
    "Industrial Designer: Or a find  a finding function ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: you know .",
    "Project Manager: that's definitely interesting .",
    "Industrial Designer: That's quite a  yes .",
    "Project Manager: It uh it separates our product from others uh as well .",
    "User Interface: Sound signal .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: go on .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes .",
    "Marketing: Well , I just said that . And uh  well , this obvious , and he also said it .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . So that's what the market tells us .",
    "Marketing: Uh that's about it , yes .",
    "Project Manager: Yep . Okay .",
    "User Interface: The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .",
    "Marketing: Uh mo uh zap buttons most .",
    "User Interface: So",
    "Marketing: Volume , they are  uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So",
    "User Interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design  The perfect design for those  only those buttons . And first um",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yep .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well , the technical uh  there  I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering ,  the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Well",
    "Marketing: Yeah , that's uh   a problem . Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes .  Th that's a bit of  that's a problem .",
    "User Interface: Another device is not a solution .",
    "Project Manager: Well",
    "Industrial Designer: Usually",
    "Project Manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,",
    "User Interface: It should be uh uh",
    "Project Manager: like um turning on and off the the the lights .",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh yes .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your TV set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep .",
    "Project Manager: Reports rep respend response to it .",
    "Industrial Designer: And um",
    "User Interface: just like uh the phones Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing .",
    "User Interface: the",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: But uh th",
    "User Interface: But but TVs don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh",
    "Industrial Designer: No , so we we should use something else .",
    "Marketing: And you",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um",
    "User Interface: But I believe you will have an",
    "Marketing: Yeah , and usually",
    "Industrial Designer: We do not control the TV set so well .",
    "Marketing: And even if the TV set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your TV ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want  to make so it's   is easy as possible for our customers ,",
    "Marketing: and it's",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: so we should think about",
    "Project Manager: So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se",
    "User Interface: I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .",
    "Industrial Designer: It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .",
    "Marketing: And b",
    "Project Manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , a peak . Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .",
    "Marketing: So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , that's true .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes ,",
    "User Interface: But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the TV . Just a little antenna or uh something .",
    "Industrial Designer: so we don't want that .",
    "Industrial Designer: Maybe we can  Something like that .",
    "User Interface: Well if you lost th",
    "Industrial Designer: Well ,",
    "Project Manager: Well uh",
    "Industrial Designer: is there not something f something more easily",
    "User Interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the TV and press that button because they lost the  their remote .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well , I don't think uh  .",
    "User Interface: Uh that's just uh",
    "Industrial Designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh  . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: so w we should use have  uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .",
    "User Interface: just a base station next to the TV is the best possibility .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .",
    "Industrial Designer: So that's not a good idea .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . I will .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: because that's his  his field of expertise .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: um and it will become more costly also .",
    "Project Manager: Yep .",
    "Industrial Designer: Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp",
    "User Interface: And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .",
    "User Interface: It's a unique item uh",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market .",
    "Industrial Designer: So",
    "User Interface: It will be an  a unique feature of our remote control .",
    "Project Manager: It's a different  exactly . It's an uni an unique feature ,",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and  probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .",
    "User Interface: And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: What should we choose in in design ?",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .",
    "User Interface: Well , the extra functions .",
    "Project Manager: So",
    "Marketing: I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most  the second-most used function .",
    "User Interface: Used option .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that .",
    "Marketing: Uh well  yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .",
    "Marketing: So  Yeah . Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Well , we skip that .",
    "Marketing: So",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .",
    "Industrial Designer: No , no .",
    "Project Manager: No .",
    "User Interface: So",
    "Marketing: Nope .",
    "Industrial Designer: So that's out of the question .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .",
    "Industrial Designer: So",
    "Project Manager: Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .",
    "Industrial Designer: I think also . Yes . Well ,",
    "Project Manager: No .",
    "User Interface: So",
    "Industrial Designer: we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay ,",
    "Industrial Designer: and",
    "Project Manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple",
    "Marketing: Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions   uh then they uh might ,",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "Marketing: 'cause young people uh like new features .",
    "Project Manager: Mm yeah .",
    "Marketing: So",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's right .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , so this is is kind of uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm .",
    "User Interface: Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Well , is it  maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Maybe it's more important to make the  make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless",
    "Project Manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual uh  I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise .",
    "Project Manager: But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah , I don't know yet .",
    "Project Manager: Because we do not implement uh a user history .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . There's  no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .",
    "Project Manager: I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um",
    "Industrial Designer: W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that .",
    "Marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes .",
    "User Interface: But does it  uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board .",
    "User Interface: should we just use a  Um it's already uh  oh , we have a blank . Oh .",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah , something like that . Oh",
    "User Interface: It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what  which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick .",
    "Industrial Designer: It's not really a stick , but  Yes . Yes .",
    "User Interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , it can break down .",
    "Industrial Designer: Hmm .",
    "User Interface: or uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes , yes .",
    "User Interface: just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: And  Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think .",
    "Marketing: A younger uh  Huh .",
    "Industrial Designer: But you're the marketing man .",
    "Marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll  it  uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .",
    "User Interface: Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that .",
    "Project Manager: Uh-huh .",
    "User Interface: The programme up and down .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , yeah .",
    "User Interface: And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay , that's good .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , but w we still  we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's  um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have  has the information to discuss about that , I think .",
    "Project Manager: Um well , for  we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yes ?",
    "Project Manager: We need to um have the uh the user function  uh the functions decided and um  uh our target audience .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "User Interface: but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?",
    "Project Manager: Um well , I do not want a full uh  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay .",
    "User Interface: The ten digits .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: Well , for example , that that's what we should think about .  l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but",
    "User Interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yes .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . A bit of a split mode .",
    "Industrial Designer: Change .",
    "Project Manager: Uh l like  Yeah .",
    "User Interface: yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes , yes .",
    "Project Manager: Dual channel watch .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , well um",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: m maybe I should write that down .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well",
    "Industrial Designer: you're the secretary .",
    "Project Manager: Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ?",
    "Marketing: Mielsen .",
    "Project Manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh  Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm okay ,",
    "User Interface: Alright .",
    "Industrial Designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , that's that's",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: if you want to do it , Sebastian .",
    "User Interface: Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Sure .   .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , um   Okay , so so um   uh",
    "Project Manager: Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes , that's important .",
    "Project Manager: And and do we want um the ten digits ?",
    "User Interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well , are are you sure ?",
    "Marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button .",
    "Industrial Designer: I'm not so sure .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well , that's complicated ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think  but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so .",
    "User Interface: I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay ,",
    "User Interface: Uh and I think the most",
    "Industrial Designer: I can imagine when",
    "Project Manager: I agree actually .",
    "User Interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it ,",
    "Industrial Designer: I can imagine when you're  when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .",
    "Marketing: Well",
    "User Interface: but",
    "Industrial Designer: But if you're uh a regular TV user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh    you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .",
    "Project Manager: But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .",
    "Marketing: But",
    "User Interface: Yep . The older people only use five of them .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well ,",
    "Marketing: Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ?",
    "Marketing: and if if we  And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .",
    "Project Manager: Often .",
    "Industrial Designer: No , you're probably right .",
    "Marketing: So",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?",
    "Project Manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the",
    "Industrial Designer: The design .",
    "User Interface: On the design .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Well , y then there should be  should done  be done something specific with it .",
    "Marketing: Well",
    "Project Manager: You c  you can d make them very fancy",
    "Marketing: And",
    "Project Manager: by um   I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: So I'm I'm  I do not agree",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .",
    "Project Manager: Exactly , exactly .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Marketing: And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for",
    "Project Manager: Okay , speech .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: And it's very easy uh to find your remote control .",
    "Project Manager: To find  yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Uh  If if we would um drop the ten digits",
    "Industrial Designer: But maybe when we uh",
    "Project Manager: but keep the programme and the volume ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay , okay .",
    "Marketing: Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Marketing: Yes .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .",
    "User Interface: So",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button  uh remote control function .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: So that's that's a big advantage , I think .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , g good .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: But maybe can  we we can think something smart about it .",
    "Project Manager: Yep .",
    "Industrial Designer: There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .",
    "Project Manager: But  But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?",
    "Industrial Designer: You have to do nothing for it .",
    "Marketing: M",
    "User Interface: Twelve dollar fifty .",
    "Project Manager: Because it seems like a very",
    "Industrial Designer: Maybe , maybe not .",
    "Marketing: And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem .",
    "Industrial Designer: I'll have to find that out . Yes . So  No , that's very cheap .",
    "Marketing: 'Cause when",
    "Project Manager: Is a cradle very cheap ?",
    "Industrial Designer: It's  Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .",
    "Project Manager: I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well .",
    "Industrial Designer: It's  Yes , but they're they're mass production .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: They're very cheap .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: So it will cost us p practically nothing .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um  I would like to hear um  maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?",
    "Marketing: Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So  I don't think that's a big problem",
    "Project Manager: Okay . Okay , so",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh  Profitable . We we  yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .",
    "Marketing: Yes . Yeah , profitable .",
    "Industrial Designer: Profitable .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: Yes .",
    "Project Manager: O okay .  Um Roo .   Nothing to add .",
    "User Interface: I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .",
    "Project Manager: Sebastian ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ? Great .",
    "Industrial Designer: so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one  the  those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that  these kinds of things .",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving .",
    "Project Manager: Yep .",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not  do not implement these buttons .  If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board",
    "Industrial Designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that  we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: And this even uh makes it more cheapy .",
    "User Interface: But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: The board .",
    "User Interface: The circuit board .",
    "Industrial Designer: The circuit board .",
    "User Interface: The fewer buttons you can use on it .",
    "Project Manager: No , it's th",
    "Industrial Designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .",
    "Project Manager: yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , okay .",
    "Project Manager: It's the other way around , yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage .",
    "Project Manager: It shouldn't be a big issue .",
    "User Interface: Well it  then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh  especially for the voice recognition .",
    "Industrial Designer: So  Yes , because I don't know  Yes . I d I really don't know . So",
    "User Interface: No .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: It can be costly . Maybe not .",
    "Project Manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes .",
    "Project Manager: Um I'm not sure how how that",
    "Industrial Designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh  have a lo uh look at it .",
    "Project Manager: Yep .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , great . Um  well , I think we're qui quite done .",
    "User Interface: We're done , I think .",
    "Project Manager: Um for now we will have the lunch break .",
    "Industrial Designer: How nice .",
    "Project Manager: Um I'm  don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out .",
    "User Interface: Me neither .",
    "Project Manager: Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um  the Interface Designer , um I would like to  the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept .",
    "User Interface: Interface  industrial .",
    "Project Manager: Uh  I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well , we understand .",
    "Project Manager: And um",
    "User Interface: Uh the only problem is it  that it depends on the divisions  the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well",
    "Project Manager: Well , i it should be easy ,",
    "User Interface: Well",
    "Project Manager: that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um  um yeah , some some fancy lights .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm yes .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: I think that's what we decided .",
    "Industrial Designer: So we drop the voice recognition ?",
    "Project Manager: No no no , we didn't",
    "Industrial Designer: Or",
    "Project Manager: but it shouldn't be integrated",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh .",
    "Project Manager: yeah , it's  of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now",
    "Project Manager: No .",
    "Industrial Designer: or can we decide next meeting ?",
    "Project Manager: We can decide the next meeting . Yep .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Because I'll have some updated info on that uh",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching .",
    "User Interface: Yep .",
    "Project Manager: And I'm sure the market will um uh   uh will change , adapt",
    "Marketing: Hmm .",
    "User Interface: Adapt .",
    "Industrial Designer: Adapt .",
    "Marketing: Left .",
    "Project Manager: and um so",
    "Marketing: Hmm .",
    "Project Manager: we will see that . Um yeah , that's it for now .",
    "User Interface: That's it .",
    "Project Manager: Any other questions",
    "User Interface: 'Kay .",
    "Project Manager: or can we have the lunch ?",
    "Industrial Designer: We can have the lunch .",
