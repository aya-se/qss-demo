Uh normally I was one of them .", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: Come on .", "Project Manager: Hello .", "Marketing: Check check check check .", "Project Manager: Oop .", "User Interface: Why won't it wake up ? Is it on ?", "Marketing: The power light doesn't work . You turned it off .", "User Interface: But how ? Ah , there it is .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Uh .", "Industrial Designer: I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . So I'll discuss them with you .", "Project Manager: Okay , we're just going to the  later .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , I received an email as well .", "Project Manager: So we're going to talk about the conceptual model .", "Marketing: Oh .", "Marketing: Hmm .", "User Interface: Which one was mine ?", "Project Manager: So that's me .", "Project Manager: Uh okay . So  Uh okay . Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute .  What's it called , I dunno . Whatever .", "User Interface: The minutes .", "Project Manager: Okay , so we just talked about uh  Oh you want me to show that there or", "User Interface: No ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm no .", "Marketing: Uh", "Project Manager: Okay ,", "User Interface: just tell us .", "Project Manager: we just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um  It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text TV still has to be a possibility . And it has to be easy to learn . That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text TV button . That are the functions . That right ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Yes .", "Project Manager: So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your", "Marketing: Shall I start ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: No . Okay well  I received an email  Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following .  The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh  This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh LCD or uh speech recognition .", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Marketing: But um  this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .", "Project Manager: But we already have the flashing flashing light on the", "Marketing: Uh maybe maybe something new .", "User Interface: Yeah , more .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Marketing: We have to discuss about it s uh  Okay , uh", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Well , I'll I'll get back on it .", "Marketing: features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari  uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Marketing: But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .", "User Interface: Spongy .", "Marketing: But spongy , what what does spongy says ?", "Industrial Designer: Spongy .", "User Interface: Spongy , like sponge .", "Marketing: Spongy . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So rubber , kind of .", "User Interface: Uh soft materials .", "Project Manager: But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be  flexible .", "User Interface: Yeah , but  Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: It's like a sponge .", "User Interface: Soft , sponge .", "Marketing: So it's also a stress-ball .", "Project Manager: That's a good  That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , somewhat like", "User Interface: Yeah , but  Yeah .", "Project Manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the  remote control ?", "User Interface: How are you gonna make it ?", "Project Manager: R_ soft .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,", "Marketing: Uh", "Industrial Designer: I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Okay ?", "Marketing: What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot .", "Marketing: And uh some basic uh colour fronts .  Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .  Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh  Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget .", "User Interface: Yeah , I'll get back on that .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Marketing: So", "Project Manager: It's very uh difficult to to to do it .", "Marketing: Intro", "Project Manager: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Well ,", "Marketing: Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem .", "User Interface: I got f also an email from the the technology department .", "Marketing: So  Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .", "User Interface: They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Well", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: I'll check what they exact mean .", "Marketing: Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .", "User Interface: So uh", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: and it's easy to implement .", "User Interface: th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so  Um but uh", "User Interface: if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement LCD as well .", "Marketing: Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can", "User Interface: Since you have to uh configure speech thing .", "Project Manager: But that's definitely more expensive than", "User Interface: Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .", "Marketing: Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be  .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but a telephone   Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a LCD and and it's about t two hundred Euros .", "User Interface: Yeah , so uh we gotta de", "Project Manager: So uh", "User Interface: We have to decide on that .", "Marketing: Yeah . Okay . That was this ?", "User Interface: Mm uh", "Industrial Designer: Oh I got an email uh  And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And  Um  They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So", "User Interface: L_D_C_ doesn't require", "Industrial Designer: it's m the most expensive . Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip .", "User Interface: Okay . And speech recognition ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , probably too .", "User Interface: Advanced  . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but", "User Interface: I'll I'll give you my design .", "Industrial Designer: Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .", "User Interface: Yeah okay . So we   Well we can  I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um  This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones .", "Project Manager: Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .", "User Interface: More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out  both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: It's the most important part , I think . But  And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .", "Project Manager: Yeah , maybe the teletext tel", "User Interface: Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable ,", "Project Manager: No .", "User Interface: but it's", "Marketing: No , I don't uh  I don't like it .", "User Interface: Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten .  And I think", "Industrial Designer: But it  That's on on the display .", "User Interface: No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So the focus is on these two parts .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So you don't see all the buttons you else need .", "Project Manager: But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .", "User Interface: Uh well um", "Project Manager: So you can't use your thumb for it .", "User Interface: This is how it is now . Um  Here uh  Well we have volume .", "Project Manager: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: I think it is on uh on the bottom too .", "Project Manager: down there . But it's not not the best best .", "User Interface: Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .", "Project Manager: Yeah , why not .", "User Interface: For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more .", "Industrial Designer: Scroll .", "User Interface: By just putting the volume on the side .", "Project Manager: And the channels as well .", "User Interface: And and just channel buttons here .", "Project Manager: Oh yeah .", "User Interface: But I think uh", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , or uh maybe uh  The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .", "User Interface: Well . Yeah , well it's  Basically it's it's here .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's better .", "User Interface: They're on top ?", "Project Manager: Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text TV . Put that on the button bottom .", "Industrial Designer: Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .", "User Interface: You mean uh these to the low ?", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button .", "User Interface: Oh okay . Well , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom .", "User Interface: Mm  Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll", "Industrial Designer: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .", "User Interface: Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to  . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay .", "User Interface: And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh  you don't see 'em very good .", "Industrial Designer: That's that's good , but", "User Interface: I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay .", "User Interface: But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: So we can uh switch these to", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .", "Industrial Designer: No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top .", "User Interface: Okay . Yeah , maybe", "Industrial Designer: But uh we we can switch those two ,", "User Interface: Those two , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: yeah .", "User Interface: And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh  Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right .", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we  I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah , that's cool .", "User Interface: To use", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: No .", "User Interface: So that's something we have to decide on .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , we have to keep it simple .", "Project Manager: We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .", "User Interface: Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not  Nothing square-like .", "Project Manager: Okay , so  Hmm , okay .", "User Interface: Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved  square .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Square . Like .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think .", "User Interface: Okay . So not", "Industrial Designer: So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .", "User Interface: Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of", "Project Manager: Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the  remote control .", "Industrial Designer: looking , I think .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: So the colours also .", "User Interface: Mm   Yeah , it's", "Project Manager: So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .", "User Interface: Black yellow control .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .", "User Interface: Yeah , but uh  I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But", "Project Manager: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .", "Industrial Designer: No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but", "User Interface: Yeah , okay .", "Industrial Designer: We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think .", "User Interface: Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So", "Project Manager: Yeah , it's cool . Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue", "Project Manager: And still trans", "User Interface: Yes .", "Project Manager: Still still transparent .", "User Interface: So", "Industrial Designer: and", "Marketing: Oh yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah . But with all with logo on it .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um   Then the components . The case has just a  Here's black .", "Project Manager: Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ?", "User Interface: Well one of the options .", "Industrial Designer: S", "User Interface: You can  Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: So you can just replace them I think . That was the idea ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , we could do that .", "User Interface: or just uh release one .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box .  Five different", "User Interface: Yeah , uh  Or just uh sell different ones .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Cool .", "Industrial Designer: So you can still th look through it .", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: I uh I dunno .", "Project Manager: It it could be like a Nokia , like  plastic .", "User Interface: A more  Yeah , just uh", "Marketing: Uh uh", "Project Manager: That's better prob", "Industrial Designer: With the hard hard buttons .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: I think uh rubber really has an odd look .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the  uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't  Is  uh a button uh um   How do you say it ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's it's all on one level .", "Marketing: It it didn't it i it don't come out of the  on the background .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , on one level .", "Marketing: It is in uh the c a remote control uh", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I know what you mean . So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: like mobile phones . Like uh the iPod .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Uh just", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's cool .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ?", "User Interface: I dunno what uh kind of material it is .", "Industrial Designer: I think . Or maybe", "User Interface: But", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Just only the basic uh", "User Interface: Oops .", "Project Manager: basic remote control from normal plastic ,", "Project Manager: and", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: the rounds of it from softer s", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And um   Then the L_E_D_ .", "Project Manager: I dunno .", "Industrial Designer: The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s .", "Project Manager: Y", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: Cool .", "Industrial Designer: But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So if you put", "Project Manager: Y i if you  The numbers could be can be", "User Interface: Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh", "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: Or it runs the whole", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So", "Project Manager: They can choose .", "User Interface: Yeah , you can halfs transparent ,", "Industrial Designer: Or no", "User Interface: or just that it's comes out a bit .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights", "User Interface: Different , I think , also .", "Industrial Designer: or", "Project Manager: Blue .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ?", "User Interface: Blue or red .", "User Interface: Whatever you want it , I think .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Uh depends on the colour of the", "Project Manager: Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it .", "Marketing: Uh i", "Project Manager: You have to choose", "User Interface: Yeah , that's true . But", "Industrial Designer: No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So", "Project Manager: Is it  Okay .", "Marketing: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: I I know  I dunno . Is", "Marketing: but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ?", "User Interface: Yeah , it can .", "Project Manager: Yeah , okay .", "User Interface: 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well .", "Marketing: You", "Industrial Designer: Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive .", "Project Manager: Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just  No , just some LED .", "User Interface: I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone .", "Industrial Designer: I think it's", "User Interface: And I can change the colour of it .", "Project Manager: Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it  I th I don't think so .", "User Interface: Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So", "Marketing: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Then uh some more technical things .", "Industrial Designer: I don't know what it is , but it should be there  I think .", "Industrial Designer: Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things .", "Project Manager: Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so", "Industrial Designer: W  So we d we just need this and  this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things .", "Industrial Designer: Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .", "User Interface: I'm sure we can fit in .", "Industrial Designer: So I guess we j we just need that .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I don't know what they do or", "User Interface: Yeah okay .", "Marketing: Okay yeah ,", "User Interface: We just", "Marketing: you can you can change  Yeah . No .", "Industrial Designer: Nah , but they just said we need it .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .", "Project Manager: Yeah , a recharger maybe .", "User Interface: Yeah , we have to make sure to uh", "Industrial Designer: Yeah okay .", "Project Manager: We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah but", "Project Manager: Is that still the", "User Interface: Yes . Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an  How do you call it ? Accu .", "Project Manager: A recha Oh no . Uh  Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah .", "User Interface: Re recharger . Base station .", "Industrial Designer: Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .", "User Interface: Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Not a separate", "Project Manager: No , just rechargeable batteries .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one .", "Industrial Designer: Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh  Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda .", "Marketing: Ah cool . Okay .", "Project Manager: But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .", "User Interface: So if you hold it , it gets powered .", "Industrial Designer: If you hold it . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and  Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors ,", "Project Manager: It's dark in the room . No .", "Project Manager: It's just batteries ,", "Industrial Designer: so", "Project Manager: that's cheaper  .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .", "User Interface: Mm . So", "Industrial Designer: So we can't use the flat buttons .", "User Interface: we need uh two D_ .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Definitely .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think . Um these kinda materials can be used .", "Project Manager: But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think so too .", "Project Manager: The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , scroll wheels um", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But I think just the volume is enough .", "User Interface: Uh  For channels it's not handy ,", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: because you scroll too fast .", "Industrial Designer: And uh the LCD . So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an LCD .", "Marketing: Mm", "Project Manager: I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels .", "Project Manager: Yeah , okay .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: And um  Yeah , that was it I guess .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or", "Project Manager: Oh just sk", "Industrial Designer: We haven't decided yet .", "Project Manager: Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's", "User Interface: Uh I don't think a rubber case looks", "Industrial Designer: L", "Marketing: Uh but we have to do something about the trend .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ?", "Marketing: The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh .", "User Interface: Yeah , okay . That  Uh fruit and veg , or", "Marketing: And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two .", "User Interface: Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers .", "Marketing: Uh yeah i Just  Just on front .", "User Interface: So you can  the the spongy  yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control .", "Project Manager: No .", "Marketing: Neith uh I don't like it uh neither .", "Project Manager: No .", "User Interface: I just can't imagine it .", "Industrial Designer: So just hard plastic ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , I think .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: Titanium . It's mentioned here uh .", "Industrial Designer: Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive .", "Project Manager: But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,", "Project Manager: more rounded .", "Industrial Designer: you can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah , that's right .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: So  We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . So the energy uh is the recharger .", "Project Manager: We already know that . Just a normal battery .", "User Interface: Yeah . We have batteries .", "Project Manager: Okay . The chip-on-print is a normal one .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Regular .", "Project Manager: Okay , the case is just a plastic one .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one .", "Project Manager: Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular .", "Industrial Designer: You have the simple one , regular and advanced . So it's b should be regular uh the second .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: I think I'll just check it .", "Project Manager: And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel .", "User Interface: Yes .", "Project Manager: That's pretty much it .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: And a flashy light .", "User Interface: User interface concept .", "Project Manager: So uh I'm not sure . But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . But", "User Interface: I dunno either .", "Industrial Designer: Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ?", "User Interface: Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .", "Project Manager: Yeah . That's for the next one .", "Industrial Designer: So we should did it here ?", "Project Manager: That's for th", "User Interface: So we're staying here ?", "Project Manager: Uh that  I think that's the next next meeting .", "Industrial Designer: Or should we do it in the next meeting ? Okay .", "Project Manager: But you definitely get a specific instruction .", "User Interface: Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: But th think about something that's more rounded . Just  And more  It has to be", "User Interface: Yeah , uh I dunno . But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones .", "Project Manager: Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom .", "User Interface: Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those .", "Project Manager: Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . O um if you draw it like this , you get a  What the fuck is it ?  Okay . Mm  Doesn't work .  You see what I mean ?", "Industrial Designer: What ?", "Project Manager: If I draw here   It draws about four centimetres lower than", "Industrial Designer: Oh . Okay .", "Project Manager: Nah okay . Just  . Maybe you can make it like this . And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um  It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one .", "Industrial Designer: Like a very big scroll-wheel .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Maybe , I dunno .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Okay , so we  have this at the moment .", "Industrial Designer: I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .", "User Interface: Yeah , you", "Project Manager: Okay , so", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: we'd have this . Is that okay ?", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: that's a little problem , of course , as well .", "Industrial Designer: I think it's probably better .", "Project Manager: And", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger .", "User Interface: Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh  That's not scrollable too easy .", "Project Manager: Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? Still on the bottom", "Industrial Designer: I think in middle .", "Project Manager: or", "User Interface: Uh wh what is the middle part ?", "Project Manager: That's the numbers .", "User Interface: Numbers , okay .", "Industrial Designer: Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .", "User Interface: Yeah , I agree as well .", "Project Manager: It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .", "User Interface: Use the dz", "Project Manager: Because you already have the volume here , so  You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other .  back and forth .", "User Interface: Yeah , that's right .", "Project Manager: So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well .", "Industrial Designer: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .", "Project Manager: But that's not  want to zap very quick , so", "User Interface: Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah ? Is this a opportunity ,", "User Interface: And then you use those uh", "Project Manager: or you don't want a different", "User Interface: Yeah , of course uh .", "Industrial Designer: Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so", "Project Manager: Why ?", "Industrial Designer: Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up", "Project Manager: But still the next  It's still the next one . Doesn't make", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is   If you put them", "Project Manager: Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference .", "User Interface: Yeah . I I think it's  It's it's obvious , I think .", "Industrial Designer: But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing .", "Marketing: Yeah , that's not not  It's not al uh always the same .", "Project Manager: But it's exactly th", "Industrial Designer: In uh  On most on most remote controls .", "Marketing: Every remote control's uh different .", "User Interface: Yeah , I think", "Industrial Designer: So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .", "Project Manager: I dunno . I  You already have the volume on the side ,", "User Interface: No , uh I think", "Project Manager: so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: So it's uh", "User Interface: I think it's s so simple", "Industrial Designer: I dunno .", "User Interface: you just", "Project Manager: So but that's for that's for you ,", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: 'cause it's", "User Interface: Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it .", "Project Manager: Okay , so hmm . What did  What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno .", "User Interface: Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?", "Marketing: Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .", "Project Manager: And the LED .", "User Interface: No , you have uh  It is", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape .", "User Interface: Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic .", "Industrial Designer: So", "User Interface: You have to look at that image of the iPod .", "Marketing: Yes . Okay .", "User Interface: More that uh kind of style .", "Marketing: And a bit uh", "User Interface: Not not the old grey black", "Project Manager: Uh  Yeah .", "Marketing: Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have", "User Interface: Where you can put a ve Uh we have  If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right .", "Marketing: Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ?", "Project Manager: Yeah , five . Let's give five .", "Marketing: Or more or", "User Interface: Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh", "Marketing: And um uh  uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic .", "User Interface: Yeah . Um", "Marketing: Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project .", "User Interface: I think  Yeah . That's your choice , I think huh .", "Industrial Designer: No , tha that will be", "Project Manager: So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ?", "User Interface: Yes .", "Project Manager: So you could put it like that ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , so top down .", "Project Manager: okay .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm ?", "Marketing: Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station .", "Industrial Designer: Do we have to design that w as well ?", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh I'm not sure .", "Industrial Designer: The docking station ?", "User Interface: Yeah , I think so .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least .", "Marketing: Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , just a recharger .", "User Interface: Yeah , just where you're around something . Li Yeah , we had one example .", "Industrial Designer: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .", "User Interface: Mm . Mm .", "Marketing: Yeah ,", "User Interface: Which w", "Marketing: but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then .", "User Interface: Here you see one that's very round .", "Industrial Designer: Oh yeah , okay .", "User Interface: So I think that can be all kind of shapes .", "Project Manager: But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . That's all .", "Industrial Designer: Of the remote control ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah", "Project Manager: Just round it up  .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod  . But", "Project Manager: No . Yeah . Yeah .", "User Interface: More rounded . Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . Since it's  This is also rounded .", "Project Manager: No , just just the corners .", "User Interface: I think i", "User Interface: Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh  As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes .", "Project Manager: Shapes .", "User Interface: Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new .", "Industrial Designer: Not in depth . Yeah , but   Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new .", "User Interface: I've uh  I had a lot of picture of old ones . And all curves have already been done .", "Project Manager: It's a bit annoying , isn't it ?", "Marketing: Yeah . What do we do wrong ? Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square .", "User Interface: Yeah okay , yeah well", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . I would do it", "User Interface: Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but", "Marketing: Yeah , it", "Industrial Designer: Like in this kind of shape or", "Marketing: Uh it's very annoying . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: I dunno . I dunno if it's handy .", "User Interface: I think it will only look more like the old remote controls .", "Marketing: Uh", "Industrial Designer: This ?", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing .", "User Interface: Yeah okay . But uh I had a lot of pictures  Oh I can show you here  what the old ones look like .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "User Interface: Curves , curves .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: You've more  there as well .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "User Interface: It wasn't very small one .  very simple .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: That is for elderly .", "Project Manager: So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I don't know .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: And you have the scroll button inside .  Okay .", "User Interface: Yes . Just a simple scrollb", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of  Skip that one as well .", "User Interface: Doesn't have to be .", "Project Manager: Okay . Yeah , it's cool .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , though that's a trend . If we want to make it . But yeah , I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are .  So", "Marketing: Uh the t the trend is", "Project Manager: Rubber spongy .", "Marketing: spongy and fruity .", "User Interface: Yeah . No . Spongy", "Marketing: But yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Spongeball kinda .", "User Interface: and", "Marketing: It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh", "Project Manager: Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just", "Marketing: Uh", "Project Manager: I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square .", "User Interface: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Yeah ,", "Marketing: It  The th th", "Industrial Designer: I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff .", "Project Manager: No .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: But I I think it's still for older people . You j still have older people . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public .", "Marketing: There is one  There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . It must have uh uh uh a very different", "User Interface: Yeah ,  idea . But  you're  If you look at the way remote controls are now", "Project Manager: But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy .", "User Interface: And if you make it look like the iPod", "Marketing: Yeah , they're all the same .", "User Interface: Yeah okay . So that's already a very big change", "Project Manager: Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the  wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction .", "User Interface: compared to", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: Ye yeah . Well uh", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , we could do that .", "User Interface: Could .", "Marketing: Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: No , I think  Oh .", "Project Manager: It's right .", "User Interface: Think the scroll wheel  won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So it will just be a small small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has  if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly . So maybe you have to ask her .", "User Interface: Yeah okay . Well ,", "Marketing: No .", "User Interface: maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint .", "Project Manager: Okay . Yeah . That's probably", "User Interface: I'll be able to do a better job .", "Marketing: If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here . Doesn't work .", "Project Manager: Okay , so just finish it . So we make it a bit like m that one probably . Yeah . Is that okay ?", "Marketing: Yeah , I'll see it .", "User Interface: Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod  .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the", "User Interface: Yes .", "Project Manager: We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition .", "User Interface: Just a  Speech . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think", "Project Manager: Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a", "Industrial Designer: S", "User Interface: Well uh", "Project Manager: advanced chip .", "User Interface: then it w", "Industrial Designer: Uh yeah , I don't know . Yeah , I think so .", "Marketing: Uh", "Industrial Designer: And we we have to build in a microphone and", "User Interface: Well that's very easy . We already have uh the beeping of the  home station ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that .", "User Interface: so", "Industrial Designer: I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition ,", "Marketing: No .", "User Interface: Uh strange that I received  the information about that .", "Industrial Designer: so", "Marketing: Oh that's hard . But", "Project Manager: So", "Marketing: Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said . We have to be original and uh technological innovative . Becau", "Project Manager: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well ,", "Marketing: Yeah . But", "Project Manager: okay ?", "User Interface: So", "Marketing: Ma", "User Interface: shall we  it open then ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So we can put all the", "Project Manager: The function of that in there . Yeah .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: And we need a  Probably we need a uh advanced chip then .", "Industrial Designer: Fine . Yeah , we probably do .", "Project Manager: But it doesn't say anything about it ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: does it ?", "Industrial Designer: No .", "User Interface: Oh yeah , I", "Marketing: But we don't have any f information about the cost .", "User Interface: No .", "Marketing: We started with information about the cost was now th", "User Interface: I just I just received the", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost .

The the the", "Industrial Designer: I don't know how much , but", "User Interface: Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .", "Industrial Designer: Just in inexpensive or", "User Interface: This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .", "Marketing: And how how does it work ? Is it", "User Interface: Doesn't say . Just  You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . Because uh  So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning .", "Project Manager: It doesn't has to say anything . Just  You have to just talk to", "Marketing: No .", "User Interface: Yeah uh th that's just  It's a", "Marketing: Does it say does it say something back ?", "Project Manager: Okay , we have to stop it now . So just", "User Interface: No . Yeah , it  Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it .", "Project Manager: Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced", "Industrial Designer: But i it's a separate chip .", "User Interface: I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I don't know anything about this ,", "Marketing: Um", "Project Manager: Yeah , we just decide not to put it in ,", "Industrial Designer: but  Nah .", "Project Manager: because it's too difficult .", "Industrial Designer: I dunno .", "User Interface: Well it it would be would be a good feature feature .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: We have to stop now .", "User Interface: No no worries about the cost , etcetera .", "Project Manager: Okay , just", "User Interface: And there's a chip in it that will", "Project Manager: We have to stop it now .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Marketing: Fine ."], "topic_list": [{"topic": "Presentation on the market trend", "relevant_text_span": [["0", "104"]]}, {"topic": "Presentation on technical function design", "relevant_text_span": [["105", "211"]]}, {"topic": "Presentation on component design", "relevant_text_span": [["212", "359"]]}, {"topic": "Discussion about remote control features", "relevant_text_span": [["360", "807"]]}]}
