You should put the laptop uh right into the square .", "Project Manager: For i for the cameras , yes .", "User Interface: For the cameras Alright .", "Project Manager: Good morning , Sebastian .", "Industrial Designer: Good morning ,  Mister P_M_ .", "Project Manager: I'm fine .", "Industrial Designer: How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ?", "Project Manager: Um well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it .", "User Interface: Geez .", "Project Manager: So  Do you want to open it as read-only .", "Project Manager: Um I guess I should close it here .", "User Interface: You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um", "User Interface: sen oh stand-by . Close the the window .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud .", "User Interface: So  That's right . Ruud .", "Project Manager: Um project kick-off .", "Industrial Designer: Is there a schedule for this meeting ?", "Project Manager: Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting . Good morning , Ruud .", "Marketing: Good morning .", "Project Manager: Uh it's important um", "Industrial Designer: I shall close the door .", "Project Manager: yeah , great . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . Okay . Okay . Um we're here to develop uh a new product .", "Project Manager: Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Um  and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Is that correct ?", "Industrial Designer: That's correct .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Um  we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .", "User Interface: Alright .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ?", "Project Manager: There is ? Yeah , there is .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: No problem .", "Project Manager: Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: The market , we should have a look at the market . Um  we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the   the the progressions , yes .", "User Interface: Progressions .", "Project Manager: Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific  uh specification of that . Um  the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .", "User Interface: It's for the vision . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it  keep it with the functional design .  Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation .  Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um  to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system .  Um yeah , I will show that now . Um you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh", "User Interface: Sensors .", "Project Manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um well , it  it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . Okay , so not too fast writing . Um  you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day .  Um you can use the eraser to make something go away .", "User Interface: But we all use the same white-board file", "Project Manager: Yes .", "User Interface: So we can work together on it while we're", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?", "Project Manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .", "User Interface: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard .", "User Interface: Yeah , alright . Yep .", "Project Manager: Um you can choose the format , um  sorry . Uh  Let me see . Um  Well   I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um  to um  oh well , I'm  I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training  um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected .", "Marketing: Okay . Um green .", "Marketing: An animal . Okay . Um", "Marketing: Uh a wee rabbit .", "User Interface: It's a bunny .", "Project Manager: A rabbit . Okay , well great .", "Industrial Designer: Alright .", "Project Manager: Um Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .", "User Interface: But of course , Flores .", "User Interface: Blank .", "Project Manager: Sebastian is thinking about the animal .", "Industrial Designer: I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah , I'm think about it too .  Format  . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but  it works ,", "Industrial Designer: Well , I'll give it a try .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: It it should be a cat .", "User Interface: right ?", "Project Manager: Okay ?", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Project Manager: I'm guessing a horse .", "Industrial Designer: Very good .", "User Interface: With a very small  legs .", "Industrial Designer: I was very good in drawing .", "User Interface: You should feed that uh that animal .", "Industrial Designer: Well , I guess you uh get the idea .", "Project Manager: Yes , okay .  Beautiful .", "Industrial Designer: Beautiful .", "Project Manager: Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions  well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um  the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number .  Um", "Project Manager: we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development ,  um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .", "Industrial Designer: Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh", "Project Manager: Limitations .", "Industrial Designer: influations influences .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay , great .", "Industrial Designer: Okay ?  Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one .  Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but  well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device  diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .", "User Interface: And for a cell phone ?", "Industrial Designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .", "User Interface: Yeah , okay . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh", "Industrial Designer: is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .", "User Interface: But  Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: But all the TVs are uh equipped with infrared , so", "Industrial Designer: But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all .", "User Interface: y you you can  Most of them .", "Industrial Designer: So that's the point .", "User Interface: Or you shou sh use a", "Industrial Designer: So", "User Interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .", "Industrial Designer: Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: but take these things into account when you start the discussion .", "Project Manager: Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,", "Industrial Designer: Yes ,", "Project Manager: and", "Industrial Designer: so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,", "Project Manager: Okay , and and uh", "Industrial Designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .", "Project Manager: Okay . Okay , good .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Um  that was your presentation ? Okay , okay .", "Industrial Designer: That's it .", "Project Manager: Um  okay . Great . Um  I'll go back to my own presentation . Um  Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .", "Project Manager: Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um  how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?", "User Interface: Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different TVs or even different uh um  Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?", "Project Manager: Yep .", "User Interface: Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .", "Industrial Designer: Yes , I think it should be something like that .", "User Interface: It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,", "Project Manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,", "User Interface: right ?", "Project Manager: not  we're we're  it's not a", "User Interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh  don't have the information for it .", "Industrial Designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?", "Project Manager: No . No .", "Industrial Designer: No ,", "User Interface: No , okay .", "Industrial Designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?", "Marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay . Okay .", "User Interface: Um  Well , the techni fu technical function uh   what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the TV . That's just the basic f technical function .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So that was my  really my part for uh this session . Um", "Project Manager: So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is  pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: It just should change the TV's state .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: So that's it . Um but furthermore", "Industrial Designer: And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah , with buttons .", "Industrial Designer: Or are there any o other controls ?", "User Interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or", "Industrial Designer: Are there only  any other cont Well ,", "User Interface: But", "Industrial Designer: I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh-huh .", "Industrial Designer: You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch", "User Interface: They're very vu vulnerable .", "Industrial Designer: w yes ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I don't know .", "User Interface: And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a TV , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the TV ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: so you must  point everywhere , so maybe infrared is", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Maybe not even pointed . Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .", "Project Manager: Okay", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Uh", "Industrial Designer: Uh is that uh  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .", "User Interface: Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or  yeah . For TV , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a TV , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in  outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: But  Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: um", "User Interface: Two more things .", "Project Manager: okay .", "User Interface: Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um   you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .", "Project Manager: Okay , s yeah .", "User Interface: You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um  in dark too .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: So when it's dark", "User Interface: Those are two really uh user interface", "Project Manager: Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha", "User Interface: Yeah .   That's perfect .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .", "Industrial Designer: Do do you", "Project Manager: Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the  such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?", "Marketing: Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .", "Project Manager: Because ?", "Marketing: Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So  we'll probably have to implement that .", "Project Manager: Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?", "Industrial Designer: Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago ,", "Industrial Designer: but I've seem to forget them   forgot them . Um  oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it .", "User Interface: Yeah . Well , maybe I um  but it it can be quite simple ,", "Industrial Designer: I I don't know .", "User Interface: you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay .", "User Interface: The uh the the digits in black .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: well , it can be for design , of course .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So", "Industrial Designer: Yes , but there's a cost limitation too .", "Project Manager: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: Well , that's more", "Project Manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: The cost price is very low .", "User Interface: Just remind something .", "Industrial Designer: Um", "User Interface: The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .", "Project Manager: Okay , okay .", "User Interface: You have a m uh", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Very good point . Yeah .", "User Interface: Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay .", "Project Manager: um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or", "User Interface: But um  Necessary , yeah .", "Project Manager: yeah . I dunno , it's uh   that's more Sebastian's uh um", "User Interface: Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh", "Industrial Designer: It's use uh a lot of uh", "Project Manager: Well does it ?", "User Interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .", "Industrial Designer: well", "Project Manager: I'm not sure . Uh", "Industrial Designer: Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's  it seems to work uh quite okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So uh technically it will be possible .", "User Interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .", "Project Manager: Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .", "User Interface: Does it", "Industrial Designer: No , you cannot .", "User Interface: It's over ?", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Um", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: See you in thirty minutes .", "User Interface: Great ."], "topic_list": [{"topic": "Team building and scope of the project", "relevant_text_span": [["0", "86"]]}, {"topic": "Remote control functions", "relevant_text_span": [["87", "98"], ["115", "163"]]}, {"topic": "Connection of remote control and TV", "relevant_text_span": [["99", "114"], ["250", "269"]]}, {"topic": "Button design of remote control", "relevant_text_span": [["164", "249"]]}]}
