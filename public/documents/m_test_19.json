Hmm .", "Project Manager: Okay , you all switched on .", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: Yep , me too .", "Project Manager: I presume we're good to go . Okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger ,", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . We wanted a stand-by function . The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . Um buttons with a combination of LCD and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . Um  and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . Um  and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ?

Um", "User Interface: 'Kay . You able to look  ?", "Industrial Designer: It's gonna have a a plastic body  um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .", "User Interface: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: um which there'd be sort of a wide choice  they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um  it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design", "User Interface: .", "Industrial Designer: and uh  the um the top LCD screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um  how do you say , it's  yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top", "User Interface: The black and white touch screen wherein people can", "Project Manager: Mm . So it's flush .", "Industrial Designer: and the buttons at the bottom would d", "User Interface: Right .", "Industrial Designer: so so it'll fully close flat .", "Project Manager: Oh right , okay , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And working on the inside we've um already said  d decided on the kinetic batteries , which  actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of", "Project Manager: So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: 'cause it's the top part that's  okay .", "Industrial Designer: Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in  and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .", "Marketing: Or something .", "Industrial Designer: And then  yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: 'Kay .", "Project Manager: I'm under the sofa .", "User Interface: Ah oka", "Project Manager: Or , that would be too complicated .", "Industrial Designer: Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's  be a standard transmission with the TV using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .", "Project Manager: Infrared  .", "Industrial Designer: Um it would it would have  obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .  And uh because , obviously , all TVs use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the  on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the  we haven't  I don't think we actually put it on .", "Project Manager: Like here .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , something like that .", "User Interface: Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here .", "Project Manager: Okay . Actually , no , it would be  it would have to be on the on the front .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah .", "User Interface: . So when it's  even if it's open here , the signals would go  .", "Project Manager: Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing ,", "Industrial Designer: So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the TV .", "Project Manager: yes .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah , that would make sense .", "Industrial Designer: And then finally um on to the interface .  The top screen , as we said , is  would be an inset um black and white LCD s touch screen", "User Interface: This one right here .", "Industrial Designer: which  yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .", "User Interface: .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: And now we've  we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .", "User Interface: Which is", "Project Manager: But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product", "Industrial Designer: No d not not actually .

Oops .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Evaluation .  .", "User Interface: Mm um I I think this is  chip .", "Project Manager: It's quite similar to what it was before , though .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Sorry .", "Marketing: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .  So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those  the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .  Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ?", "User Interface: Ah , it's perfect .", "Marketing: we're going to look at these crite So", "User Interface: Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market", "Marketing: Yes ,", "User Interface: okay .", "Marketing: we're going to come to  w we'll discuss each one", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Is that okay ?", "User Interface: 'Kay .", "Marketing: One is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating .

Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ?", "User Interface: Yeah , so you can", "Project Manager: Yeah . That works .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Marketing: Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay .

Uh two and three quarters , it that right .", "User Interface: Almost three .", "Industrial Designer: Mm yeah .", "Marketing: Two and three quarters ?", "User Interface: I think yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .", "Marketing: Okay . Two point seven five , there we go .  Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three .", "Industrial Designer: I'd give it a one .", "Marketing: Okay .

The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? The first .", "Marketing: The average", "User Interface: Yeah , I I just  it the other way .", "Marketing: oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ?", "User Interface: Uh in  Yep , I just got", "Marketing: Okay .", "Marketing: So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered  Okay ,", "User Interface: two point f", "Marketing: and we're just waiting for your rating", "Project Manager: It's just two point five for that one .", "Marketing: f", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Two point five , okay . Losing one decimal place , that's okay .", "User Interface: One is a  , seven is false , okay .", "Marketing: So what are you rating for this one , Paw ?", "User Interface: Two .", "Marketing: Two , okay . So that is eight . That brings it down to two ,", "Industrial Designer: Two .", "Marketing: nice and simple , yeah . Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .", "Industrial Designer: Two .", "Marketing: Two .", "Project Manager: I would say a two . I would say a two .", "Marketing: A two , okay .", "User Interface: Two .", "Marketing: Two . I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ?", "Marketing: We'll just put almost two ,", "Project Manager: One point seven f five .", "Marketing: because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places .", "Project Manager: Okay , mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay . Or we  or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at", "Industrial Designer: D_ .", "Marketing: it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .", "Industrial Designer: One . Yeah .", "Marketing: Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's", "Marketing: Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?", "Industrial Designer: No , no , the the base colour was um  white or or like or l sort of a light blue ,", "User Interface: White .

Uh blue .", "Industrial Designer: but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any  basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .", "Marketing: Right .", "User Interface: Any", "Marketing: So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .", "User Interface: Right .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: and", "Marketing: And the spongy feel is no problem with that .", "User Interface: Yeah , because you'll be having a  Because of the rubber case .", "Industrial Designer: No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that  otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic .", "Marketing: Okay .

I think we're set .", "Industrial Designer: yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .", "Project Manager: Do much apart from having a huge big", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: I know .
