But all  all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine . And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message and I have not yet sat down with  been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code .", "PhD A: Next time you get it maybe we should write it down .", "Grad B: Yep , we will . One of these days .", "Professor D: Yeah .", "Postdoc E: Was it a pause , or  ? OK . Was it on \" pause \" or something ?", "Grad B: No .", "Postdoc E: OK . Don't know .", "Professor D: So uh  so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , uh , then they can run off . It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , but um , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . So , I th I think  I think we should start doing that . Um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can , uh  I don't know . Wh - what  what were some of the points again about that ? Is it", "PhD F: Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up .", "Professor D: Yeah .", "PhD F: Um , at the previous  at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping  about wanting to get more data and I  I talked about this with Jane and Adam , um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new  this new student di does wanna work with us ,", "PhD A: Well , great .", "PhD F: th the guy that was at the last meeting .", "PhD A: Great .", "PhD F: And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time ,", "PhD A: What a deal .", "PhD F: uh  Yeah .", "Grad B: And what 's he interested in , specifically ?", "PhD F: So he 's  comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody ,", "Grad B: Mm - hmm . Great .", "PhD F: so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts  he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with .", "Grad B: Right .", "PhD F: But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one  one - time", "Grad B: One offs ?", "PhD F: Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the , um  to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about . I mean it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . So . Then I was um , talking to Morgan about some  new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to  listen to . And in that uh , regard , I thought we definitely w will need  it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this  this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I  You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "PhD F: Um , and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting  and maybe a networking  group meeting .", "Grad B: Right . Yep . Yeah , we 're  we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly .", "PhD F: So  So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough .", "Grad B: So . Mm - hmm .", "PhD F: But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting    meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize ,", "Grad B: Yeah .", "PhD F: but  rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . And then we need a couple that  of   We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds .", "Grad B: Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting .", "Professor D: S So", "PhD C: Yeah .", "PhD F: See , I 've never listened to the data for the front - end  meeting .", "Grad B: Yeah , we  we 've only had three .", "Professor D: Yeah .", "Grad B: So .", "PhD F: OK . But maybe that 's enough . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar ,", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "PhD F: like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same .", "Grad B: Um", "Professor D: Now , let  l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I  I don't disagree with that , but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . Uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , I actually feel the opposite need . I 'd like to have lots of different people .", "PhD F: Right . Right .", "Professor D: As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view . I 'd like to have many different speakers . So , um I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and  and uh ,", "PhD C: Mm - hmm .", "Professor D: I mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine ,", "Postdoc E: Mm - hmm .", "PhD F: Right .", "Professor D: but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people .", "PhD F: Yeah , I definitely agree with that .", "PhD C: Yeah .", "Postdoc E: Mm - hmm .", "PhD F: Definitely .", "PhD C: Yeah .", "Postdoc E: Can I  can I say about that  that the  the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers .

Oh , interesting !", "Professor D: Uh , that 's the first point .

I 'm not saying accents . u The accent 's not the problem .", "Professor D: Oh , OK .", "Postdoc E: No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency , e e just simply fluency .", "Professor D: Yeah .", "Postdoc E: I mean , I deal with people on  on campus who  I think sometimes people , undergraduates um in computer science uh , have language skills that make , you know  that their  their fluency and writing skills are not so strong .", "Professor D: Oh !

Yeah , just talking about .", "Professor D: You 're just talking about", "Postdoc E: Well , e I just think ,", "Grad B: We all had the same thought .", "Postdoc E: but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , uh , no problem .

I 'm just saying fluency .", "Professor D: But", "Grad B: Well , I think that , um  I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English .

I", "Postdoc E: Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have  Uh , so if  if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case .

So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a  of a range of them and that 's OK too .

We 're  we 're just  We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with  once we decide how to do it", "Postdoc E: Well , OK .", "Grad B: going and dealing with it .", "Postdoc E: It 's just  Yeah . OK . I  I 'll give you the short version , but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Postdoc E: OK , so  the  the short thing is um , we have uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings .

Ugh ! That 's a good point .", "Postdoc E: Now , if you want to , you know , I mean , in some cases , I  I  I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except", "Professor D: Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that .", "Postdoc E: And  and I  cer and I  So , I mean , the question then becomes one level back . Um , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? Well , on the one hand , uh , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions , um and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to  they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like   OK . So , maybe , uh , maybe that 's enough protection . On the other hand , this is a small  this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the  from the first name .

Yeah .", "Postdoc E: and  and it was  and we made the decision that was kind of artificial .

Well , I would sug I  I  don't wanna change the names in the transcript ,", "PhD C: Yeah .", "Professor D: Yeah .", "Grad B: but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point .", "Postdoc E: Misleading .", "Professor D: Yeah .", "Grad B: You 're right , this is going to require more thought .", "Professor D: Yeah . L let me just back up this to make a  a brief comment about the , uh , what we 're covering in the meeting . Uh I realize when you 're doing this that uh  I mean , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . Uh , and so , uh  and so I was proceeding some somewhat at random , frankly . So I think what would be helpful would be uh , i and I 'll  I 'll mention this to  to Liz and Andreas too , that um , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any  any , uh , uh , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll  I 'll take the role of organizing them uh , into  into the agenda ,", "Postdoc E: OK . Sure .", "Professor D: but I 'd be very pleased to have everyone else  completely make up the agenda .

I think that  My understanding from Yen Is it Yen - Ching ? Is that how you pronounce her name ?", "Professor D: Uh  Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah .", "Postdoc E: Oh , uh Yu - Ching ? Yu - Ching ?", "Grad B: y Yu - Ching .", "Postdoc E: was that um , they will  that they will adopt the  part of the conventions that  that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down .
