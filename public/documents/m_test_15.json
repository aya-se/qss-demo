    "User Interface: Yes .",
    "Project Manager: okay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly  that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it  that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for  what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever .  Okay so  uh no , this is a  these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . And you already saw  you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .",

    "Marketing: Ah I can see it now .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",

    "Project Manager: No , that's okay , thank you .",
    "User Interface: It's just to get used to it .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: I thought these pens would be just um  uh you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? No , not yet , okay .",

    "Project Manager: Oh",
    "Project Manager: this is definitely the best one .",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . Okay ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Excuse me .",
    "Project Manager: that's  . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . The production cost are about half the price of selling price ,",
    "User Interface: Piece of cake .",
    "Project Manager: sorry .",
    "User Interface: Uh easy .",
    "Project Manager: So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have  a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the  and everything , so just have a look how it  we think about remote controls .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a  a universal remote control ?",
    "Project Manager: Oh yeah , that's a good question .",
    "Marketing: Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart .",
    "Project Manager: I think it's  I'm not I'm not sure ,",
    "Marketing: So I",
    "Project Manager: it's not mm  I think",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it probably would be universal .",
    "User Interface: Universal .",
    "Marketing: Because",
    "User Interface: And only television ? Or more devices ?",
    "Project Manager: I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so  not sure , but",
    "Industrial Designer: Hmm , maybe , I don't know .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros",
    "Project Manager: Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect .",
    "User Interface: Ah okay .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , I think .",
    "Industrial Designer: And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , everything",
    "Industrial Designer: and",
    "Project Manager: just  so a lot of buttons  on the remote control .",
    "Industrial Designer: okay .  Yeah , probably .",
    "User Interface: Not just a TV .",
    "Project Manager: No , just everything .",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: . so yeah ,",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not  nothing very special , but um",
    "User Interface: Well we can try to make it special .",
    "Project Manager: yeah , that's right .",
    "Project Manager: So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user",
    "User Interface: Well",
    "Marketing: Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television ,   we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter .  Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons . Um I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh  use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .",
    "Project Manager: Hmm yeah .",
    "Project Manager: That's right . Should be a good point .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Nothing  N",
    "Industrial Designer: And how big should it be ?",
    "Marketing: No . Yeah .",
    "User Interface: It shouldn't be too big ,",
    "Marketing: I dunno um",
    "User Interface: but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .",
    "Project Manager: Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer ,",
    "Marketing: Yes",
    "User Interface: maybe more trendy .",
    "Project Manager: But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open .",
    "User Interface: Fold open ,",
    "Project Manager: Okay ,",
    "User Interface: where you can see uh more options . I think",
    "Project Manager: yeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah",
    "Marketing: Ah",
    "Industrial Designer: n",
    "Marketing: that's that's",
    "Project Manager: if you just",
    "User Interface: Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and TV channels and inside things you don't use that often .",
    "Marketing: Ah right right .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , or you c",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .",
    "Marketing: Oh that's good , yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah b I wanted",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh maybe be uh it's it's",
    "Project Manager: There are buttons on it .",
    "User Interface: No you can make an uh manual in it .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .",
    "User Interface: But that's",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh like a a to have",
    "Marketing: Yeah , but",
    "User Interface: Yeah , I think it's much uh  too expensive .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , maybe it would .",
    "Marketing: Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen .",
    "Marketing: And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , too fragile .",
    "Marketing: Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh",
    "Project Manager: No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever .",
    "Industrial Designer: Kid-proof .",
    "User Interface: Yeah  .",
    "Industrial Designer: And uh how about the batteries ?",
    "Marketing: Um",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh should you put it in a recharger or a  just",
    "Project Manager: Oh maybe that's a good idea ,",
    "Marketing: Ma maybe a home station .",
    "Project Manager: just to put it on your television and just s recharge ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: you never have to use any batteries .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm yeah .",
    "User Interface: Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno .",
    "User Interface: Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?",
    "Project Manager: I dunno .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive ,",
    "Marketing: Ah yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .",
    "User Interface: Maybe have  uh",
    "Project Manager: Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably  it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , 'cause well",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are  uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , that's right , yeah .",
    "Marketing: and now you can put it always at the same place .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Maybe it's  Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive .",
    "User Interface: Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately .",
    "Marketing: Yeah . You can  yeah , you can buy it with it .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh",
    "User Interface: Rechargeable .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: or you can change your batteries ,",
    "Marketing: Oh yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: so .",
    "Project Manager: The option , just the option , that's cool .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Uh I I set something on paper already ,  size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: uh it has to lay good in the hand ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: you you have to uh",
    "Project Manager: Has it be  has  does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control",
    "Marketing: Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know",
    "Project Manager: or",
    "User Interface: Well I think we have to look at that ,",
    "Marketing: if we",
    "User Interface: 'cause well you can do  the standard way , but then you won't",
    "Marketing: You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah",
    "Marketing: but it's very hard to",
    "Industrial Designer: N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .",
    "User Interface: Well you can um have uh  the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .",
    "Marketing: Nah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: so you can do something unique with that .",
    "Industrial Designer: And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you  can still uh do the th the functions .",
    "Marketing: Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , just for the TV and just the normal function , that's fine .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,",
    "Industrial Designer: But n",
    "User Interface: Yeah , yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah , but uh i  basically when I'm watching TV I'm just using like five buttons or so ,",
    "Marketing: and if you fold it open",
    "Project Manager: But maybe it's",
    "User Interface: Yeah  .",
    "User Interface: That's what I meant .",
    "Industrial Designer: so .",
    "Project Manager: maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh  what's it's called ?",
    "Marketing: Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an  uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .",
    "Project Manager: Maybe it's hard t",
    "User Interface: Uh",
    "Project Manager: No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control  .",
    "User Interface: Okay , but yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Just think about it .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: There's some more things . We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . So you know what you have to  what you have to do ?",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the",
    "User Interface: No , what you want to do with it .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , I think this  if you  you have to n know if it's for s a TV , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Also from a user , but all these things together .",
    "Marketing: Okay . Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , everything .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ,",
    "User Interface: that you want on a",
    "Project Manager: no maybe not not uh  , that's not a f that's something for for for  yeah .",
    "User Interface: Technical fun fu",
    "Project Manager: That's not for you . Just if",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have .",
    "User Interface: What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , it's alright .",
    "User Interface: I already wrote some down , some ideas .",
    "Marketing: Yep .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , just  is that okay ?",
    "User Interface: Yep .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",

    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Marketing: Okay , well done .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so  your laptop .",
    "User Interface: I will .",
    "Marketing: Oh Paul .",
    "User Interface: It didn't say that .",
    "Project Manager: No , sorry .",
