Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh  people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that .

But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions ,", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .", "Project Manager: Yeah , the main  that's the main stuff anyway , I mean", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: and you don't want to  I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do", "Marketing: Mm .", "Project Manager: and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .", "User Interface: So simplification of symbols you could think of .", "Project Manager: Um .

Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: 'Cause it doesn't make  when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at ,", "Marketing: Mm .", "Project Manager: it's obvious what you're doing , um .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,", "User Interface: Mm-hmm . Menu , alright .", "Marketing: I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Uh uh", "Marketing: so you've got a little LCD display .", "User Interface: Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an LCD di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .", "Marketing: With menus , yeah , yeah .", "User Interface: And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ?", "User Interface: You mean to save it lesser number .", "Project Manager: Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?", "User Interface: Right .", "Project Manager: I don't think they tape things ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so", "Project Manager: I don't think they use", "Marketing: Right . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,", "Project Manager: Mm , yeah , the age gap .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , what it just needs to be  as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: I don't know , I d", "Industrial Designer: But I don't know how", "Project Manager: I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .", "Industrial Designer: Oh yeah .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost  in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one", "Marketing: Right .", "Project Manager: and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white LCD thing anyway , I'd assume .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: Teletext has got that option as well .", "Marketing: Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ?

Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is  you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Mm , okay . S", "Project Manager: I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about", "Industrial Designer: Y", "User Interface: It might", "Marketing: Yeah ?", "User Interface: it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Yes , no that's important .", "User Interface: But it might have its cost implications .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , like smaller .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?", "Project Manager: Mm .", "User Interface: Right .", "Marketing: Something that's easily moulded and produced .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys .", "Project Manager: Um , right , okay", "Industrial Designer: No uh uh", "Project Manager: we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things .

Just just a quick thing about the um", "Project Manager: Sure .", "Industrial Designer: about what you're saying about the uh  does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of  I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh  we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui", "Marketing: Ah right .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: I mean you don't  you you can still have plastic", "Marketing: Sure b y yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and it'd look quite good but", "Marketing: But  yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know  th that was my main point ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper ,", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: I presume it would .", "Project Manager: I would", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah .", "Project Manager: it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything .
