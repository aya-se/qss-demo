    "Project Manager: Help .  It's up there ? That screen's black .",
    "Project Manager: Alright , okay . Okay , that's fine .",
    "Marketing: Oh God .",
    "Project Manager: Are we done ? Right , okay um , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place .",
    "Project Manager: Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?",
    "Marketing: Uh , no that's okay ,",
    "Project Manager: Okay , um",
    "Marketing: sorry .",
    "Project Manager: I'll go over what we decided last meeting ,",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , TV , video equipment .",
    "User Interface: Sorry .",
    "Project Manager: Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . Um , our budget would have to affect um  try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of  oh oh you can see it , okay  . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .",
    "Project Manager: Um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . Okay . Um , three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ?",
    "Marketing: Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information ,",
    "Project Manager: No that's fine , that's fine .",
    "Marketing: is that okay ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah I'll go first . Can I grab the",
    "Project Manager: Unplug me .",
    "Industrial Designer: Thanks . What do I have to press ? Oh , F_ eight ?",
    "Project Manager: Um , F_N_ function F_ eight .",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh right , yeah . Okay . Maybe",
    "User Interface: Yep .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .",
    "Industrial Designer: 'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What  the first thing  question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that  well it wasn't really my area because  I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one  .",
    "Industrial Designer: Um and uh  I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm . Could I  can I interject to ask a question there ,",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah sure .",
    "Marketing: is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the  surrounding it ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .",
    "Marketing: Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah the the",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: They are .",
    "Industrial Designer: well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption",
    "Marketing: Oh I see .",
    "Industrial Designer: and how much you need to send the data across .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .  Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the  w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the TV unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh  just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .",
    "Industrial Designer: It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the  uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would  the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the TV receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to  whatever um whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using and since that that's another use and  reason to use that infrared because that's what all TVs use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the  it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of  d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa  thing that you could have ,",
    "Marketing: Mm . Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: I  th that was just sort of a general point there .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: And that's uh  yeah .",
    "Marketing: That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .",
    "Industrial Designer: Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there ,",
    "Project Manager: Okay , thank you very much .",
    "Industrial Designer: so if you wanna",
    "Project Manager: Um , would you like to continue on from that ?",
    "User Interface: Yep .",
    "Industrial Designer: Ooh .",
    "User Interface: 'Kay . It can be",
    "Project Manager: Or , maybe move the laptop over .",
    "User Interface: okay , that's okay with me .  further .",
    "User Interface: Oops . Why's it not working ? F_ eight , right ?",
    "Project Manager: F_ function .",
    "Industrial Designer: Function F_ eight yeah .",
    "User Interface: Okay . Mm why's it in the right ?",
    "Marketing: No . The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , it's connecting  .",
    "Industrial Designer: No , no yeah it's just  .",
    "Marketing: Meter adjusting .",
    "User Interface: okay .",
    "Project Manager: Oh , there  .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's  it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering  maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will  this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you  you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like  it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh  added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not  of no use of punching in the uh  trying to put in those things in  on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in  add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's  so this is  if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use  usage and all that .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "User Interface: Uh any comments like , if you want ?",
    "Project Manager: 'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end ,",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah sure .",
    "Marketing: 'Kay .",
    "Project Manager: Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . Oh , God . Right , okay .",
    "User Interface: I think you'll have to",
    "Marketing: Have I got to keep this here ?",
    "User Interface: You can't",
    "Marketing: Does it matter ?",
    "User Interface: It'll have to  this can't be pulled .",
    "Marketing: I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ?",
    "Project Manager: We just do the best we can .",
    "Marketing: Uh , whoops .",
    "User Interface: You'll have to push it a bit more .",
    "Marketing: Will it manage ? Bit more ,",
    "User Interface: Yep .",
    "Marketing: oh dear .",
    "User Interface: Yeah this is more than enough . Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: There we go , I've got a bit more of the cable  .",
    "Marketing: Oh .",
    "Industrial Designer: There we go .",
    "Marketing: Is that okay ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah I think you can pull it out now .",
    "Marketing: Thank you ,",
    "Marketing: just pull it closer a little bit .",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh you should be able to  and",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , you might .",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah , there you go .",
    "Marketing: Get it right over , okay , thank you .",
    "Project Manager: Ah . Look at that .",
    "Marketing: Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .  Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .  Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there .  Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take  said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh  when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this .  I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,",
    "User Interface: 'Kay .",
    "Marketing: but I think I'll just keep it simple ,",
    "Marketing: if there's any more information I can email you extra details ,",
    "User Interface: That's fine .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Marketing: is that okay ?",
    "Project Manager: Right , um",
    "Industrial Designer: Huh .",
    "Project Manager: we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext ,",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um  our control is only going to be for TV , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that   it limits the cost for us ,",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?",
    "Project Manager: It says for TV only , so  looks like it's just",
    "Marketing: Just channel-hopping .",
    "Project Manager: yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but  I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for TV only . But I mean , general TV controls do do video as well .",
    "Marketing: Would that imply video use ?",
    "Industrial Designer: T yeah yeah . I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g",
    "Project Manager: I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined TV and videos don't you ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . If yeah",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm , yes .",
    "Industrial Designer: and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the TV anyway so on to on to like the TV hard drive or so .",
    "Project Manager: Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and  programming .",
    "User Interface: Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?",
    "Marketing: Yes .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons ,",
    "User Interface: Ten perc",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Marketing: I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: Pens",
    "Industrial Designer: and they're not that great anyway .",
    "Marketing: In fact I've just called up that table there ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Alright , okay .",
    "Marketing: we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an LCD screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Alright , okay .",
    "Marketing: So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there ,",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah but um on on that again I just thought  'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: bu",
    "Marketing: Oh yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: so I thought that could be quite a",
    "Marketing: Right .",
    "Project Manager: We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Project Manager: um because it is something I  it needs to be  the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: maybe  on the TV  you could put like a pack on the TV or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the TV and it beeps",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yes . That's a super idea .",
    "Project Manager: but that's  that sounds a lot cheaper to me .",
    "Industrial Designer: Hmm . Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Um  the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well .",
    "Marketing: Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno ,",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "Marketing: you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may  and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs  ?",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Sure .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs",
    "User Interface: Alright .",
    "Industrial Designer: I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .",
    "User Interface: Right .",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .",
    "Industrial Designer: Just",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah , yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "User Interface: So",
    "Project Manager: What about  you were talking about the buttons ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers",
    "Industrial Designer: 'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just  yeah .",
    "Project Manager: yeah ? Um so you  it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the",
    "Industrial Designer: No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to  you don't actually have to press them you just",
    "Project Manager: You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Um , think that might appeal  I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people ,",
    "Marketing: Mm . Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: trendy kind of a thing .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def",
    "Project Manager: Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can  oh yeah that's obvious what that's for",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm , mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um  if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big",
    "Project Manager: Were too big .",
    "Industrial Designer: because um  they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh  so if you  I don't know what  'cause you  obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , uh maybe to  as uh  it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .",
    "User Interface: So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: I think we have to design one product",
    "Industrial Designer: Hmm . Huh .",
    "Project Manager: and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Marketing: Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .",
    "Project Manager: It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: I'm j I really can't get my head round this one ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about .",
    "Industrial Designer: I  yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause  without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel",
    "Marketing: Mm . I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know .",
    "Industrial Designer: and it becomes",
    "Project Manager: Or a speech recognition ,",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah . Yeah , speech recognition ,",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: which is extremely expensive ,",
    "Industrial Designer: but",
    "Project Manager: I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue .",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yes . Mm-hmm . Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um .",
    "User Interface: We could focus on the biggest market .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "User Interface: If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Ge uh",
    "Marketing: And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .",
    "Project Manager: We are  we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want um it to be fashionable ,",
    "Project Manager: they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume  associate that with the older generations .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Project Manager: Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm  .",
    "Project Manager: but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people .",
    "Marketing: Mm . Mm . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "Marketing: and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first  it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the TV ,",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Video plus .",
    "Project Manager: yes . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah .",
    "Project Manager: I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: because you've got your general record anyway so if you  there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in",
    "Industrial Designer: Just whack in the number .",
    "Project Manager: and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that ,",
    "Industrial Designer: And you w",
    "Project Manager: it's just a number .",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that ,",
    "Project Manager: No .",
    "Industrial Designer: you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway ,",
    "Project Manager: You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway .",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah .",
    "Marketing: Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful  .",
    "Project Manager: It is",
    "Project Manager: after um  if you look in the newspaper , TV guide or any TV guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards",
    "Industrial Designer: It's not  Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth",
    "Marketing: Ah , hmm .",
    "Project Manager: so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times ,",
    "Marketing: Right .",
    "Project Manager: um and it has been around for quite a long time .",
    "Industrial Designer: It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .",
    "Project Manager: No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that",
    "Marketing: Superb . Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm .",
    "Marketing: Yes .",
    "Industrial Designer: Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it  you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "Marketing: Right .",
    "Industrial Designer: and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .",
    "Marketing: Excellent , mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: So that  yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: But just to have that function would be would be really good .",
    "Marketing: Right .",
    "Project Manager: Okay so",
    "Marketing: Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me ,  to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing TV remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones .",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "Marketing: Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um  the companies who uh who you deal with have actually  they've they've got an obligation to to help you out",
    "Marketing: Mm . Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: and also  I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having",
    "Marketing: Right .",
    "Project Manager: The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your TV's not doing it . Taking your TV and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ?",
    "Marketing: Alright .  Yes",
    "Marketing: If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel ,",
    "Marketing: but I mean for  if there were any more  or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for TV and video ,",
    "Project Manager: I think so .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I mean",
    "Marketing: we're not gonna put any   okay , just a thought .",
    "Project Manager: Um",
    "Industrial Designer: I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .",
    "Project Manager: Instruction manuals . But I mean they're  there's customer service ,",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Department , yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm . Sure .",
    "Project Manager: and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "User Interface: Right .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to  for a phone maybe he might walk down the street ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .",
    "Industrial Designer: And they're",
    "Marketing: Not for such simple functions",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah , they should be f yeah .",
    "Marketing: because we're focusing on that ,",
    "Project Manager: Mm . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible",
    "Marketing: yes okay .",
    "User Interface: Simple .",
    "Project Manager: because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .",
    "Project Manager: It does ,",
    "Industrial Designer: It's the uh",
    "Project Manager: you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah .",
    "Project Manager: and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about .",
    "Marketing: Sure , okay .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: Um , what other functions ? We need  I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about  c 'cause you've got the dilemma between  oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but",
    "Project Manager: Well they la they they last quite a long time ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: and if you had uh  when you  th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah and if  yeah if you if you had if you had one of those  uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh",
    "Project Manager: Yeah it could be on that  yeah , okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah on that as well so .",
    "User Interface: So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?",
    "Project Manager: S",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah",
    "Project Manager: Yes .",
    "Industrial Designer: some sort of docking station or",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: Rechargeable with a docking station .",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah .",
    "Project Manager: So the rechargeable which would be your field .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine ,",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .",
    "User Interface: Right .",
    "Project Manager: Yes ,",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: which it is cheaper in the long run as well .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Um , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either ,",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many   how much you try and make it simple ,",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Project Manager: um",
    "Marketing: And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical ,",
    "Project Manager: They do .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely  an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that .",
    "Project Manager: Okay so we've got a flip-screen .",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Um",
    "User Interface: What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here ,",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: and you don't have to  you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .",
    "Marketing: Slightly curved , curved .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Project Manager: 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway .",
    "User Interface: y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "User Interface: the way you h hold of  it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth .",
    "Project Manager: Can you look into the company logo ? Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .",
    "User Interface: Current .",
    "Project Manager: I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something ,",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design ,",
    "Project Manager: while also making it quite different from anything else that's there .",
    "User Interface: We could look in at that but  Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells ,",
    "Marketing: I mean look at the mobile .",
    "User Interface: logo could become as  you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .",
    "Project Manager: Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different .",
    "Marketing: I think that's   that sounds a really attractive idea ,",
    "User Interface: A sea shell ?",
    "Marketing: I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of  yeah and that opens out into your flip-top .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . I think it's a really nice idea",
    "User Interface: Yeah we could look in at that .",
    "Marketing: and plus you can get   you know even though we're using plastic , you can still  I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .",
    "Project Manager: Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . You could have different kind of casings .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and",
    "Marketing: Yeah . Mm-hmm . Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't  not gonna lose it so much  either . It's easier to  bit nice to handle .",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "User Interface: Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are  whichever appeals the most like ,",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: that could be the most common design .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "User Interface: But we can like think of five , six designs .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . Right , I think we have to round it up , um",
    "Marketing: Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything .",
    "Project Manager: Sure .",
    "Marketing: So it's no teletext , it's only for TV and by implication video ,",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Marketing: our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus .",
    "Project Manager: That was um in cutting down the number  that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date",
    "Marketing: Right . Right . Right , so when they press for programming you  it comes up on the LCD , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and  Or was  is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just  that was an add-on feature ?",
    "Project Manager: It's  kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .",
    "Marketing: Uh-huh . Right . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ?",
    "Project Manager: Um it could be it c It  yes ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature ,",
    "Marketing: Right .",
    "Project Manager: you know , drawing attention to that . And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .",
    "Marketing: Mm , and the rechargeable batteries .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Was there anything else there that we  in the new new project requirements ?",
    "Project Manager: Um",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm . That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at ,",
    "Project Manager: Yes . Yes .",
    "Marketing: what preference  so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .",
    "Project Manager: And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .",
    "User Interface: For detection , right .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the  I  the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um . I think",
    "User Interface: Yep ,",
    "Project Manager: Yep ,",
    "User Interface: I think",
    "Project Manager: and different from what's out there . Yep , I think that's us .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "User Interface: True .",
    "Marketing: What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Marketing: Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ?",
    "Project Manager: I think you might get guidance , but um I th Instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing ,",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: u um , they're  everyone's got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Um .",
    "User Interface: Oops .",
    "Marketing: Whoops , questionnaire four .",
    "User Interface: We should f",
    "Project Manager: Yes , right . Okay .",
    "User Interface: I think it's time for us to get back to",
    "Marketing: 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think .",
    "Project Manager: Right , okay . I think you can email me , if there's any more questions . Um and I'll be able to not answer them ."
