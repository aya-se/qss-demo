Because otherwise I will already open it .", "Marketing: Um  Mm , don't think so .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Unless uh things have suddenly change again .", "Project Manager: Is it much changes ?", "Marketing: Uh don't know . Maybe uh you've got new information ,  like uh last time .", "Project Manager: Uh I didn't  No no . I do hot have  Only the same information .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Hello , Sebastian .", "Industrial Designer: Hello hello Mister P_M_ .", "Project Manager: I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room .", "Industrial Designer: Well , that's where the thinking goes on .", "Project Manager: Oh , it's that Roo again , always late .", "User Interface: Bongiorno .", "Project Manager: Bongiorno .", "Industrial Designer: I think you should punish him .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: You're the P_M_ .", "User Interface: Punish .", "Project Manager: I see some interesting", "Project Manager: okay .", "User Interface: You wish .", "Industrial Designer: Possibilities , yeah ?", "Project Manager: People , welcome back .", "User Interface: Welcome . Uh", "Project Manager: The third meeting .", "Marketing: Oop .", "Project Manager: Um I have some points I would like to  uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um  first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: so I could  uh can uh um use that in the in the report .  Um the second thing , um  I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . That's quite strange .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: Okay . We'll come to that later , I g I think .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: Um  the agenda for now  uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?", "User Interface: No .", "Industrial Designer: Not at all .", "Project Manager: Okay . Um", "Marketing: No .", "Project Manager: we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um  I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .", "Marketing: 'Kay . Hmm ?", "User Interface: Alright .", "Marketing: Oh .", "Marketing: .", "Industrial Designer: Just press the okay button , it works .", "Marketing: Yeah ,   Okay .", "Project Manager: Um yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah . My method ?", "Industrial Designer: How surprising .", "Marketing: Well , findings . Uh  Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,", "Marketing: and that they want spongy material . Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .", "Marketing: Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes  uh m material . But we  since we are concentrating on uh the younger group", "Project Manager: Uh w wait a sec wait a se", "Industrial Designer: Oh wait uh wait up .", "Project Manager: uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes", "Marketing: 'Kay .", "Project Manager: Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah  okay . The feel of  to be spongy", "Industrial Designer: Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?", "Marketing: Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .", "Industrial Designer: Not something dull .", "User Interface: But they like dark colours ,", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: you said in the p", "Marketing: No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects .", "User Interface: Okay . Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow .", "Marketing: But", "User Interface: I had", "Industrial Designer: But can you can you go back to that slide ? The  uh", "Marketing: Which one ?", "Industrial Designer: just one slide back ,", "Marketing: This ?", "Industrial Designer: no no no . Yes . Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .", "Marketing: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ?", "Marketing: Uh well , it might .", "Marketing: But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But  Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .", "Project Manager: Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it  maybe it rubber or or", "Marketing: Yeah , exactly .", "Project Manager: yeah .  Okay .", "Marketing: Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials ,", "User Interface: Or we could make  oh .", "Marketing: but that doesn't mean we should use wood , So", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .", "Project Manager: Well , that's interesting .", "Industrial Designer: It's quite interesting .", "Project Manager: You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .", "User Interface: Yeah , o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh  telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: Yeah , yeah .", "User Interface: It's the it's the rubber uh cover .", "Project Manager: Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .", "User Interface: And it's uh colourful .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: It looks likes a banana .  We have the fruit , we have the colours .  We have the simple design .", "Project Manager: Do you know the phone ?", "Industrial Designer: I don't know the phone ,", "Project Manager: It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five ,", "Industrial Designer: but I can imagine it .", "Project Manager: I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away ,", "User Interface: Um thirty five .", "Industrial Designer: Oh , that one , yes .", "Project Manager: the very", "User Interface: And the b the light blue and  it's also in yellow .", "Industrial Designer: Now I kn uh  oh , I know , I know . Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .", "Project Manager: You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th", "Marketing: I've seen it ,", "Project Manager: Okay . Okay . Um uh", "Marketing: but", "Project Manager: okay . Do you have   uh thit  that was", "Marketing: 'Kay . Uh that's about it .", "Project Manager: Okay .  Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the  our target group .", "Marketing: Yes .", "Project Manager: And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .", "Marketing: Uh soft material .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So  So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?", "Marketing: Uh the fancy look and feel .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .", "Marketing: Yes . Apparently .", "Project Manager: Okay , Roo ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: could you do your presentation ?", "User Interface: Mm-hmm . Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um", "Project Manager: Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .", "User Interface: Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and  just um , well , a weird um shape .", "Project Manager: Shape .", "User Interface: So I suggest  I couldn't uh  I had a small uh mock-up uh  sign on the  on  paper .", "User Interface: But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple  f uh a shape on uh  in um PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um  I mean this is how you hold a remote control .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Project Manager: Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,", "Industrial Designer: Slippery .", "Project Manager: s because um", "User Interface: But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .", "Industrial Designer: You have to grab it .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah , exactly .", "User Interface: So it's easy in your hand  Uh indeed .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,", "Project Manager: Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier .", "Project Manager: Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: So m Yes .", "Project Manager: okay .", "Industrial Designer: But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .", "Project Manager: Okay , good .", "User Interface: Great .", "User Interface: Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: yeah .", "User Interface: So if you have the voice recognition , you can  you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .", "Project Manager: Okay , b but I think we'll", "Industrial Designer: Okay , but I'll I'll go into that ,", "Project Manager: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a  it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing .  We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .", "User Interface: Yeah . Right .", "Industrial Designer: But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source  source . Which brings me to the different energy sources .  Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh  remote controls .", "Industrial Designer: You really have to imagine like  winding up your  uh", "User Interface: Great .", "Project Manager: Well , it would be very new to the market ,", "Industrial Designer: I d", "Project Manager: but", "Industrial Designer: It would be very new ,", "Industrial Designer: but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Uh   Well ,", "Industrial Designer: this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching TV uh or when you're  you you have to um make some kind of energy  kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .", "User Interface: Like the watch .", "Industrial Designer: It have  it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing .", "Project Manager: I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . It's very funny indeed .", "Project Manager: I mean solar is  of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Indeed .", "Project Manager: Um hand dynamo", "User Interface: But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and", "Project Manager: Well , maybe m", "User Interface: if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I know .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yes .", "User Interface: You you walk", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: and uh  but uh you  you're sitting on a couch .", "Industrial Designer: But you know you know from your own watch  your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy .  the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a  in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,", "Project Manager: Yeah . And wha", "Industrial Designer: well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So , but maybe  maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .", "Project Manager: Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .", "Industrial Designer: Uh yes , it does .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I'll come to that later .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .  The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . Um  uh in the indicators we have the LCD displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four", "User Interface: Mm-hmm . Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . That is possible too . Yes .", "User Interface: But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels  I had some  I had some information about it too .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: I don't think  there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .", "Project Manager: Well", "User Interface: I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .", "Industrial Designer: Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .", "Project Manager: This will be the remote , right ?", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?", "User Interface: Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,", "Industrial Designer: Uh it's do it's done before .", "Project Manager: Because this is how you keep it", "User Interface: but", "Industrial Designer: Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .", "User Interface: But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for", "Project Manager: Volume ?", "Industrial Designer: Well , it's it  well , i what he means is there's an  button integrated in the scroll-wheel .", "User Interface: A volume , okay .", "Industrial Designer: There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .", "Project Manager: Well , what about mute ?", "Industrial Designer: About mute .", "Project Manager: Thi i i m I guess uh th", "Industrial Designer: Well , yes .", "Project Manager: this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Yes . Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .", "Project Manager: And click it to muten the device .", "Industrial Designer: Well , okay . It's quite goods .", "Project Manager: And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yes .", "Project Manager: So maybe um  I guess that  that's something you two uh need to think about .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .", "Marketing: Um   Uh well ,", "User Interface: Wheel .", "Marketing: it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .  But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And  Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .", "Project Manager: Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .", "Industrial Designer: So maybe it's not no  .", "Project Manager: Nokia has a  well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .", "Project Manager: Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: It doesn't use a   . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here .", "Project Manager: For you too , yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .", "Industrial Designer: Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .", "User Interface: So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .  yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay . Sebastian . Um", "Industrial Designer: Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate LCD displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: There's  there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation .  About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .", "User Interface: Yeah yeah , you can um  I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word  you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So  so", "User Interface: Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function", "Industrial Designer: okay .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yeah .", "User Interface: and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: and then it's um  well , I believe it's uh", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: It performs the action . Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what  which he believes it is .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So you say mute , he repeats mute and you  makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the LCD display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .", "Project Manager: Okay . Uh well  uh", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: d did we already decide on the display ? To", "Industrial Designer: Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about .", "User Interface: Yeah . Well , I don't have um  I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information  uh y I don't think you need it on a display .", "Project Manager: No .", "User Interface: Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh", "Industrial Designer: I I don't think either .", "User Interface: 'cause uh  uh all  any TV can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,", "Industrial Designer: No . I don't think you need it .", "Project Manager: On screen display . Yeah .", "User Interface: yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay , well", "Project Manager: th", "Industrial Designer: my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the  a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper .", "Project Manager: Okay . Good .", "Industrial Designer: So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing .", "Project Manager: Kineti okay .", "Industrial Designer: The kinetic thing it  it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm  I think you should combine it with batteries .", "Project Manager: Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,", "Industrial Designer: Otherwise it will not  too advanced ,", "Project Manager: too", "Industrial Designer: uh well .", "Project Manager: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: It's  in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but that  that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .", "Industrial Designer: But  Yes . And I think it's more robust .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: It's more uh Uh it's more functional .", "User Interface: But what about um the markets  uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium", "Project Manager: No no , but the uh um  that's what Sebastian said .", "Industrial Designer: The titanium thing uh we have to skip it .", "Project Manager: He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different .", "User Interface: Okay . Oh ,", "Project Manager: So um", "User Interface: sorry . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and we should uh use wood or something like that .", "Project Manager: No ,", "User Interface: And I would think", "Marketing: And", "Project Manager: r", "Marketing: yeah ,", "Project Manager: rubber with colours .", "Marketing: the  yeah , the older people liked wood .", "Industrial Designer: Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber .", "Marketing: No the", "Project Manager: Colourful and", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , spongy materials .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy .", "User Interface: And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?", "Industrial Designer: So  Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple", "User Interface: Okay , but we also  uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker", "Industrial Designer: Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh  a different", "User Interface: oh ,", "Project Manager: But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,", "User Interface: evalu", "Project Manager: or", "Industrial Designer: I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .", "Project Manager: I it's too dull . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I don't think c our customers will like it .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot  um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So I think this is the best of two worlds .", "Project Manager: Okay , what about um  the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour", "Industrial Designer: Yes . It's it's  uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: It's very unlogical .", "User Interface: But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .", "Project Manager: Well", "Industrial Designer: Well the there has to be some pointing at . But", "Project Manager: It depends also on your on your", "User Interface: Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just  to the other wall .", "Project Manager: Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably  you're probably right .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um  yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .", "Industrial Designer: All lights get absorbed , yeah .", "Project Manager: So", "Industrial Designer: Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So  it has an  it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .", "User Interface: And the regular chip .", "Industrial Designer: I think uh it gives us the advantage of", "User Interface: And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes , yes .", "Project Manager: I like the scroll wheels uh idea .", "Industrial Designer: And uh skip  and skip the LCD part .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I don't think it it's any uh value added thing .", "User Interface: No . Think so too .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: Well , it looks  uh yeah , well um", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,", "Industrial Designer: Technology .", "Project Manager: and I mean LCD is", "Industrial Designer: Yes . It's not very flashy and new .", "Project Manager: well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard", "Marketing: Standard ?", "Project Manager: than than  Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . That's the problem .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "User Interface: But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .", "Project Manager: Mm yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Uh I think our customers will go insane .", "Project Manager: Okay , okay .", "Industrial Designer: It's it's too much .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or", "Marketing: Nah , um n no , I don't think so . M", "Project Manager: No ? Sebast uh nee , Roo ?  Roo , do you have any other", "User Interface: Um no . Nothing more .", "Project Manager: Nothing more . Um", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Uh the n the next phase will be um the um  not the", "Project Manager: Sebas", "Industrial Designer: what is the next phase  f Flores ?", "Project Manager: Well , we we  need to describe uh decisions now .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: So um", "Industrial Designer: So i", "Project Manager: on the energy , well , we decided .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Chip .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , okay .", "Project Manager: User interface um", "User Interface: Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? Yeah , okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yes , they can work .", "User Interface: Sorry , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: They cannot work with double-curved .", "User Interface: Oh , sorry . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: That's that's problem . I'll check it for you .", "Project Manager: Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Keep it in mind . And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .", "Project Manager: Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: And I'm going uh to plan my holidays .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: The project drawing is for the next", "Industrial Designer: So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh", "Project Manager: Yeah , it's it's uh  when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .", "User Interface: Yeah , right .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?", "Project Manager: Yeah ? I can . Um maybe one of you could write it down .", "Industrial Designer: I'll do .", "Project Manager: Great . Um  Uh you you need to help me . Um", "Industrial Designer: Okay . W start with the casing .", "Project Manager: The casing is curved , single-curved .", "User Interface: Single-curved .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , single-curved case . Okay . What about the energy source ?", "Project Manager: Traditional batteries uh and solar .", "User Interface: But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ?", "Project Manager: No ,", "User Interface: 'Cause if we have to choose", "Project Manager: they can be complementary . Uh al al I uh", "User Interface: yeah ?", "Industrial Designer: I I think they can . Yes .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Well , uh", "Project Manager: Every device", "User Interface: What if not ?", "Industrial Designer: It it should be . There should be really no problem .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: They can be supplementary . That's no problem .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , um", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: th", "Industrial Designer: So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar .", "Project Manager: Battery and solar , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . What about uh the finishing of the case ? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?", "Project Manager: Yeah , with colourful rubber .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red .  uh black and yellow .", "Project Manager: Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .", "User Interface: Grey and yellow .", "Industrial Designer: Grey yellow , okay .", "User Interface: Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .", "Project Manager: Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course ,", "Marketing: Hmm .", "Project Manager: but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .", "Industrial Designer: Oh , I think it's uh  it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ?", "Project Manager: Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .", "User Interface: I believe the  But you have already um  you must have a red uh on and off button . And um  Well  well", "Project Manager: Well , it it doesn't have to be red . Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Project Manager: or or  I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: Or black and yellow .", "Project Manager: Black and yellow , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay ,", "Industrial Designer: but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But", "User Interface: Well , there is .  Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print ,", "Industrial Designer: Oh , I've read .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: with  and uh", "Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes ,", "User Interface: No .", "Industrial Designer: but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . They're actually very slow in its techniques .", "Project Manager: Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .", "Industrial Designer: So  So I'm afraid it's not possible .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . Um more f more more decisions we made . Um  Um", "User Interface: A scroll-wheel .", "Project Manager: The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided .", "User Interface: Voice recognition , of course .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And th the  they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .", "Project Manager: Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two .", "User Interface: What what did you say ?", "Industrial Designer: Well uh you can use  well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So it has th the spongy uh feel also .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber .", "Project Manager: I think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i", "User Interface: Yeah , b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .", "Project Manager: .", "User Interface: What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .", "Project Manager: Uh is that  uh does our our supplier say so ?", "User Interface: It is not uh something uh  it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from", "Marketing: Uh didn't  did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ?", "User Interface: No , but but uh it", "Marketing: 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .", "Project Manager: Yeah . You could place a  um uh this this would be the button .", "Marketing: There  the icons .", "Project Manager: The scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place the indica th th the signals the", "User Interface: Yeah , b yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "User Interface: Yeah , that's possible ,", "Industrial Designer: That's okay .", "Marketing: So you don't touch the icons that much .", "User Interface: but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .", "Project Manager: No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or  But it's into the rubber .", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but this is on the pla", "User Interface: You have to draw the", "Industrial Designer: Yes , the signs .", "Project Manager: yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean .", "User Interface: Yeah , it's on the cover . So if you uh  You just move the problem .", "Project Manager: What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?", "Industrial Designer: Uh I see what you mean . Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: I mean", "Industrial Designer: Well , I'm I'm not so sure ,", "User Interface: Y uh can you separate these uh these", "Industrial Designer: I think it c should be Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .", "Project Manager: I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?", "Industrial Designer: I think both .", "Project Manager: I mean , I I never touch between the buttons .", "User Interface: I do .", "Industrial Designer: I do .", "User Interface: Or the s uh the sideways .", "Industrial Designer: I think", "User Interface: Or the the back . Or the back .", "Project Manager: Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the the  these buttons ?", "User Interface: I think  Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . So you just have it in your hand completely or or  i you play with it .", "Project Manager: Okay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . I'm going to leave the decision to you ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: um because you have to make its prototype , and um  yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: so I'm going to leave it  the decision with you . Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?", "Industrial Designer: Um not quite . Um what about uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ?", "User Interface: Regular .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And", "User Interface: Use with  .", "Industrial Designer: Well  no , I think that's about it . Yes .", "Project Manager: Okay . With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . The chip is is not really", "Industrial Designer: The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports LCD . That's all .", "Project Manager: Okay , well .", "Industrial Designer: And we've decided not to use LCD .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So", "Project Manager: Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished . Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um", "User Interface: . For the finishing touch .", "Project Manager: Yeah ? Yeah , um if you write  wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ?", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay .", "User Interface: Uh yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: But um Sebastian has everything .", "Project Manager: I know , but  well", "Industrial Designer: I'll put it online .", "Project Manager: Great .", "Project Manager: Right ."], "topic_list": [{"topic": "Team building and meeting agenda", "relevant_text_span": [["0", "50"]]}, {"topic": "Remote control style", "relevant_text_span": [["50", "166"], ["309", "349"]]}, {"topic": "Energy source of remote control", "relevant_text_span": [["167", "204"], ["294", "308"]]}, {"topic": "User interface controls of remote control", "relevant_text_span": [["205", "293"], ["350", "400"]]}, {"topic": "Work plan for the next phase and wrap-up of the meeting", "relevant_text_span": [["401", "581"]]}]}
