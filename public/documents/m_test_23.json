And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , that if you introduce a new construction at  at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work .", "Grad F: Mm - hmm .", "Professor E: And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions .", "Grad F: Mm - hmm . Yeah .", "Professor E: And it  to the extent that that 's true then  then it 's a big win over anything that exists .", "Grad D: So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them .", "Grad F: Yeah .", "Professor E: Mm - hmm . So that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal and any metaphorical one  and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff   you can do the same grammar .", "Grad D: Mmm .", "Professor E: And it is the same grammar . But , um , the trick is that the  the way the construction 's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container .
