    "Project Manager: Oh .",
    "User Interface: It's not saved yet .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "User Interface: So",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Our beautiful drawing .",
    "Project Manager: So just f um  So this is our agenda . You're  F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .",
    "Marketing: Oops .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Uh I didn't  Oh yeah . So these are the",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh , okay . Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report .",
    "User Interface: Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay .",
    "User Interface: Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , just",
    "User Interface: Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , and   Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know .",
    "Project Manager: Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .",
    "Industrial Designer: It's probably better . Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you  other functions .",
    "User Interface: It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .",
    "Project Manager: Maybe that's better . Yeah , that's that's a very good point .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside .",
    "Industrial Designer: Think that's better .",
    "User Interface: So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . So this is okay ?",
    "User Interface: No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , so that's  Uh I'll just have a look how much that is .",
    "Industrial Designer: The",
    "Project Manager: But um  Okay , for the",
    "User Interface: Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I I think so . I don't know .",
    "Project Manager: No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Ah okay .",
    "Project Manager: So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay .",
    "User Interface: Good .",
    "Project Manager: So you can show your prototype if you want to .",
    "User Interface: Together ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , it's  Let's do it together .",
    "User Interface: I'll give comments .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it .  Uh the material should be hard plastic . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements . Uh we have  The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , cool .",
    "Industrial Designer: And this is the the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: And the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger .",
    "Marketing: Means",
    "Industrial Designer: So you hold it like this in your right hand and",
    "Project Manager: Mm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?",
    "User Interface: Speech recognition .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , speech recognition . Just  Only one button to say it's on or off .",
    "User Interface: Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh I dunno .",
    "User Interface: Um so I've",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it .",
    "User Interface: Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .",
    "Project Manager: So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , you can  put 'em all on the back . That's for sure .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: That's uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "User Interface: We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But  You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , you can put it separate .",
    "User Interface: You  Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So  But it's enough room .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh",
    "User Interface: Uh well",
    "Industrial Designer: You wrote this , so .",
    "User Interface: Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . That was the the most important thing .",
    "User Interface: So uh the best  place , the best reach place  Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's  basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine .",
    "User Interface: Okay yeah , they",
    "Marketing: But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah okay . That's that's below that then .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .",
    "User Interface: It's uh twelve buttons .",
    "Industrial Designer: just so you get that .",
    "Marketing: Okay , but   It's rather important .",
    "User Interface: Yeah okay , just we just missed that .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: But um I'll just uh  I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular . Um  The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you   That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh  in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "User Interface: And also in the num-pads , there's also colour  light behind it .",
    "Project Manager: And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ?",
    "User Interface: So when you pre Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: How do you want to implement that ? Just on the  Maybe on the second level as well ?",
    "User Interface: We're going to implement . Yeah . Mm just a little",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , these are just basic functions , so",
    "Marketing: Ah .",
    "Industrial Designer: All the non-basic are in",
    "Project Manager: Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Um",
    "Marketing: Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay , maybe we use this button for the",
    "Marketing: That function must be  Yeah , maybe  Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions .",
    "User Interface: Yeah ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , as well .",
    "User Interface: I um",
    "Project Manager: Just make make a",
    "User Interface: To your video device .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: A second level ?",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Like a a new blank one or  Or just here ?",
    "Project Manager: No no , just on  Down there .",
    "User Interface: Is i Ah okay .",
    "Project Manager: So uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Yeah .",
    "Marketing: And h how does the second level come out ?",
    "Project Manager: Just uh if you s",
    "Marketing: Uh it slides uh along ?",
    "User Interface: Um slides I think .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , y Maybe , yeah .",
    "User Interface: It's",
    "Marketing: From from the uh beneath ?",
    "Project Manager: For the bottom .",
    "User Interface: You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough .",
    "Project Manager: No , you gotta slide it .",
    "User Interface: If that breaks then you're screwed .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , it's right .",
    "User Interface: So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um",
    "Industrial Designer: So what do we need ?",
    "User Interface: Uh i the the speech functions buttons .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , just",
    "Marketing: Menu ?",
    "User Interface: Menu button . With uh maybe uh arrows . So you can uh",
    "User Interface: scroll in the , navigate the menu . Um",
    "Industrial Designer: God damn it .",
    "Marketing: Scart ?",
    "User Interface: I think we can even put a   We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels .",
    "Marketing: Uh yeah . And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes .",
    "User Interface: So you have one left for the  Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often .",
    "Industrial Designer: So this is the",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day .",
    "Marketing: It's a f  basic uh",

    "User Interface: Uh",
    "Project Manager: Doesn't really matter . Just just uh",
    "User Interface: It doesn't really matter .",
    "Industrial Designer: I don't know the functions .",
    "User Interface: That's  Yeah well we don't have any uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . What else ?",
    "User Interface: Hmm ?",
    "Industrial Designer: What else ?",
    "User Interface: What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows .",

    "Marketing: No . Just remember where it was .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ?",
    "Project Manager: Yes , that's to remember .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay , okay .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but that's that's uh",
    "Marketing: But maybe it's not the way",

    "Project Manager: That's a functionality for the television .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , I think as well , but  Uh yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah mm nee uh  No , if i  uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the",
    "Project Manager: Okay . Yeah , but you have to search every time again .",
    "User Interface: the chip .",
    "Industrial Designer: Th i",
    "Project Manager: That's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , that's true .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I dunno . Okay .",

    "User Interface: Just like your telephone , hard plastic .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Just hard plastic . So",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .",
    "Marketing: Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh  And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?",
    "User Interface: I think just on the buttons .",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh I think just um",
    "User Interface: If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space .",
    "Marketing: Well yeah . That's too much place .",
    "User Interface: I don't think the space is worth it .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but",

Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . The Italians uh , how they think about it . And   The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: um  model .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: And this  These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um  we have to discuss about  , if we give it a one or a seven .",

    "Marketing: Uh",
    "Project Manager: It's",
    "Marketing: Yes .",
    "Project Manager: We are actu We are the",
    "User Interface: Mm .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and  and that kind of stuff .",
    "Project Manager: Flashy .",
    "User Interface: Okay . Well I think we do",
    "Marketing: The LEDs .",
    "User Interface: If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .",
    "Marketing: Yes .",
    "Project Manager: But uh",
    "Marketing: And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ?",

    "User Interface: Just um",
    "Project Manager: Oh , the same as th th the cover . But also th the light behind it .",
    "User Interface: Yes .",
    "Industrial Designer: But can you change those too , with uh the switch ?",
    "Project Manager: No , no . Make them  No , just make them black or grey or something .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Marketing: Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours .",
    "User Interface: Well we have changeable fronts , so",
    "Marketing: Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful .",
    "User Interface: So",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , just give it a one . It's okay .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: It's perfect . I think it's just what you want . Or not ?",
    "User Interface: It's hard to decide for us , but yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . It's ju so subjective .",
    "User Interface: It it's  At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , just give it a two .",
    "Marketing: Yeah . A two . Okay . The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Okay . And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: One more thing .",
    "Marketing: So",
    "Industrial Designer: Are w are we changing uh  Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? Or n no back light ?",
    "Marketing: Slide panel ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah ?",
    "Project Manager: No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers",
    "User Interface: Mm . Not needed  .",
    "Project Manager: and uh",
    "User Interface: Yeah , not needed I think .",
    "Industrial Designer: And and the switch channel is uh  There is a back light too ?",

    "Marketing: Oh , you mean th this here ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but that's unnecessary .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: What do I think is necessary necessary item ?",
    "Marketing: It's pretty cool . If you slide it open ,  it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but  I don't know if it's reachable .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Of course it's reachable .",
    "Project Manager: It doesn't make",
    "Marketing: Then we do it .",
    "User Interface: Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up .",
    "Industrial Designer: Hmm .",
    "User Interface: So you can see what's really there . Not just not re on the buttons or something .",

    "Marketing: Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , this  It is a one .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: It's okay . It's cool .",
    "Marketing: I think it's one . Okay , next .",
    "Project Manager: This is a difficult one , because we we don't  Yeah , we don't know it about the",
    "Marketing: Learnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it  But uh",
    "Project Manager: Uh  it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: It's  That's",
    "Industrial Designer: No , but you don't have to use that .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer .",
    "Project Manager: No .",
    "Industrial Designer: That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .",
    "User Interface: So I think it's easy to use , but  And learnable is a bit",
    "Marketing: Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well , I think it is .",
    "Marketing: Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .",
    "User Interface: Well y just uh f",
    "Marketing: I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or",
    "Project Manager: But the rest of it is very easy ,",
    "Marketing: Uh then the re",
    "Project Manager: because there are so so n",
    "User Interface: Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .",
    "Industrial Designer: So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .",
    "User Interface: Yes .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "User Interface: It's  Yeah it's",
    "Marketing: But",
    "Project Manager: And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .",
    "Marketing: Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ?",
    "User Interface: Device .",
    "Marketing: And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls .",
    "Project Manager: But  yeah .",
    "Marketing: 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um  easy to use .",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Marketing: Because easy to use comes after learnable .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , just  Easy to use is very cool ,",
    "Marketing: I I think it a three or something .",
    "Project Manager: so just give it a two .",
    "User Interface: Maybe three then . Learnable's",
    "Project Manager: No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm uh . The normal .",
    "User Interface: Yeah okay . Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know",
    "User Interface: Yep , true . Then a two .",
    "Marketing: Oh . Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: New features . Techno technological innovative ?",
    "Industrial Designer: The speech function and the colour . Colour .",
    "Marketing: The speech function is new .",
    "User Interface: And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .",
    "Marketing: The scrollwheel and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new .",
    "Project Manager: Slide is not n is is not new . No . I already have a",
    "Marketing: Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .",
    "Project Manager: Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: So that's not new .",
    "User Interface: But also slide that buttons come out , as well ?",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Marketing: Okay , and the the the lightning ?",
    "Project Manager: That's cool .",
    "Marketing: Is that new ?",
    "Project Manager: Yeah for a  Uh for a f",

    "Marketing: Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: So we have a pretty new uh",
    "Project Manager: There are no games on it , that's that's  It's not a one , it's a two again .",
    "User Interface: That would  And we didn't uh",
    "Marketing: It's it's it's not not LCD or something .",
    "User Interface: But then we also have the the home station .",
    "Project Manager: If you have",

    "User Interface: recharge .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but",
    "User Interface: But that's more like uh now .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , just draw it afterwards .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing .",
    "User Interface: I don't know .",
    "Project Manager: If you  Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ?",
    "User Interface: Uh  Just save , save as ?",

    "Marketing: Uh all  the the seven , uh all the seven .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . But not",
    "Marketing: No , we are not extraordinary new or something .",

    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: So you want",
    "Industrial Designer: We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So",
    "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah .",

    "Marketing: A perfect score .  No , I don't know .",
    "Industrial Designer: We're not too hard on ourselves .",
    "User Interface: This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay .",
    "Marketing: And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep .",
    "User Interface: To call .",
    "Project Manager: Oh yeah , that's still",

    "User Interface: Okay . No no , I want that in .",
    "Marketing: That's  Yeah , but it",
    "Industrial Designer: But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo .",

    "Project Manager: You s  saved it or",
    "Marketing: Yeah . I did save it .",
    "Project Manager: No . Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me . It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm  okay .",
    "Marketing: That's fine .",
    "Industrial Designer: But uh is uh uh",
    "Project Manager: So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: So that's both .",
    "Marketing: Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , and single curved curved .",
    "Industrial Designer: But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or",
    "Project Manager: No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be  .",
    "Industrial Designer: Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah , we can uh",
    "Project Manager: Probably . I just  The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was  I'm not sure .",
    "User Interface: Um  different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: See it's  I think it's okay like this .",
    "Marketing: Special form , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um  Yeah ,  okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: We get different ones , that's all . So you can put a recharger in it as well .",
    "Project Manager: But this is expensive , the sample speaker .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: This ?",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's four .",
    "Marketing: Four . It's four Euros .",
    "User Interface: Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , that's included .",
    "Marketing: So we are",
    "User Interface: Okay , then we then we need to use it .",
    "Industrial Designer: It's kind of weird that we  we get this information now , afterwards . Because",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , no .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this  .",
    "User Interface: Damn , solar cells are uh expensive .",
    "Project Manager: So  I just want you  Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Sure .",
    "Marketing: Yes .",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Paul , was there room for crea creativity ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Beautiful .",
    "User Interface: Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . I think uh everyone uh  already . So",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Or a different style .",
    "Industrial Designer: then there  we probably have been creative .",
    "User Interface: I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah . We could make a lot of different uh remote controls .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: So it's creativity .",
    "Industrial Designer: Huh .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , so the leadership  Was there a leadership and",
    "User Interface: Of course there was .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: What do you have to say about that ?",
    "Industrial Designer: No , I think",
    "Marketing: Who was the leader ?",
    "Project Manager: I dunno .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .  Just normal discussion , I think . Not",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: one leader or something .",

    "User Interface: So more like a secretary .",
    "Project Manager: Okay , next one .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Uh team work um  The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . We were not all  We were not um agree with every not agree with  .",
    "Marketing: Yeah yeah . We were not finished .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just",
    "Project Manager: We're not finished .",
    "Marketing: Uh .",
    "User Interface: Uh I think we  we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , th that's weird .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would  it .",
    "Marketing: And then",
    "User Interface: We had to",
    "Industrial Designer: Hmm hmm yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , finance .",
    "Industrial Designer: So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: But the teamwork was okay .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh",
    "User Interface: I think uh everyone listen to each other .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . 'Kay . Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work .",
    "User Interface: It was",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Just doesn't work .",
    "Project Manager: No .",
    "User Interface: Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well .",
    "Marketing: Digital pen or",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Just not work too slow .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , more accurate . Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Precise .",
    "User Interface: And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Not just pointing out on it .",
    "Project Manager: It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: And so you've",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , and p just point with a mouse .",
    "User Interface: No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: But you might as well do it in normal computer style .",
    "Project Manager: like  .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . And it's far too slow this way .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function .",
    "Industrial Designer: No .",
    "Project Manager: I think  Yeah , okay .",
    "Marketing: Digital pen .",
    "Project Manager: So we made it in time .  And we made a remote control .",
    "User Interface: We did it .",
    "Project Manager: In the budget , yeah .",
    "User Interface: New ideas found .",
    "Marketing: New ideas .",
    "User Interface: Oh",
    "Industrial Designer: What's that ?",
    "Marketing: For for for",
    "Project Manager: I don't know what it mean . Just",
    "User Interface: I just think if we uh",
    "Marketing: To gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for",
    "Project Manager: For remote control probably .",
    "User Interface: I dunno .",
    "Project Manager: No , for the project .",
    "User Interface: For remote control , a favourite for your text .",
    "Industrial Designer: Hmm .",
    "Marketing: No , for the prototype . New ideas .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . But it's for the next team . We don't have to do that .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but it  You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think .",
    "User Interface: That's for  . Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , just brainstorming basically .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Details uh",
    "Industrial Designer: So are we finished ?",
    "Marketing: Hmm .",
    "Project Manager: Yes , I think just  I just write a final report .",

    "User Interface: One two three four five six seven cameras . Mm not bad .",
    "User Interface: So that was it .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Now we can look at this .",
    "User Interface: This is",
    "Industrial Designer: We're probably not supposed to look at this , but",
    "User Interface: The old versions .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , from the previous group .",
    "User Interface: They went for uh for a universal device .",
    "Industrial Designer: The touchscreen , yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , but also a different device  .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Then an LCD uh would be handy .",
