Definitely .", "Grad B: OK , So our initial idea was not very satisfying ,  because  uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node . Uh .", "Grad D: So , a big flat structure .", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad D: Right ?", "Grad C: Yep .", "Grad B: And uh , so we  Reasons being , you know , it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that . If we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort , uh according Bhaskara we 'd be handicapped . I don't know belief - nets very well .", "Grad C: Well usually , I mean , you know , N  If you have N features , then it 's two to the N   or exponential in N .", "Grad B: And they wouldn't look pretty . So .", "Grad C: Yeah , they 'd all be like pointing to the one node .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: Uh . So then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ? So the thinking behind that was  we have the features that we 've drawn  from the communication of some  Like , the someone s The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , like \" I 'm  \" the  the abstract idea being \" I am a tourist I want to go  to this place . \" Right ? So we 're gonna set up features along the lines of where they want to go and  what they 've said previously and whatnot . And then we have  the means  that they should use . Right ? but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist  or  whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines . Or  Yes , we could things we couldn't extract the  from the data , the hidden variables . Yes , good . So then the hidden variables  hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , because we were thinking uh , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to  like  or th", "Grad C: Want to do Vista ,", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad C: right ? Because  if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry .", "Grad B: Or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a  like a  navigational point to go to another place .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: Whether the destination was their final destination , whether the destination was closed . Those are all  And then \" Let 's look at the belief - net \"  OK . So that means that I should switch to the  other program . Um right now it 's still kind of  in a toy  version of it , because we didn't know the probabilities of   or  Well I 'll talk about it when I get the picture up .", "Grad A: No one knows it .", "Grad B: OK . So this right  what we  Let 's see . What happens if I maximize this ? There we go . But uh  So . The mode  basically has three different  outputs . The probability  whether the probability of a Vista , Tango , or Enter . Um  The \" context \" , we simplified . Basically it 's just the businessman , the tourist , unknown . \" Verb used \" is actually personally amusing mainly because it 's  it 's just whether the verb is a Tango verb , an Enter verb , or a  Vista verb .", "Grad C: Yeah , that one needs a lot of", "Grad D: And are those mutually exclusive sets ?", "Grad B: No .", "Grad C: Not at all . That 's  that  that needs a lot of work .", "Grad D: Right .", "Grad C: But uh   that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter ,", "Grad D: Got it . Uh - huh .", "Grad C: so we decided that for the purposes of this  it 'd be simpler to just have three verbs .", "Grad D: Yeah . Simple .", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Grad D: Stab at it . Yep .", "Grad B: Right . Um  Why don't you mention things about this , Bhaskara , that I am  not  that are not coming to my mind right now .", "Grad C: OK , so  Yeah , so note the four nodes down there , the  sort of , the things that are not directly extracted . Actually , the five things . The \" closed \" is also not directly extracted I guess , from the uh", "Grad B: Well i it 's", "Grad C: Hmm .", "Grad D: From the  utterance ?", "Grad B: it 's so it sort of is", "Grad C: Actually , no , wait .", "Grad B: because it 's  because have the  the time of day", "Grad C: It is . OK , \" closed \" sort of is .", "Grad B: and the close it just had the  er and what time it closed .", "Grad C: Right , so f Right , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , that kind of thing is all uh  sort of  you know probabilistically depends on the other things .", "Grad D: Inferred from the other ones ?", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad D: OK .", "Grad C: And the mode , you know , depends on all those things only .", "Grad B: Yeah the   the actual parse is somewhere up around in here .", "Grad C: Yeah . So we haven't uh , managed  Like we don't have nodes for \" discourse \" and \" parse \" , although like in some sense they are parts of this belief - net .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: But uh   The idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse ,", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad C: because we 'd never do inference on it anyway , so .", "Grad D: So some of the  the top row of things  What 's  what 's \" Disc admission fee \" ?", "Grad C: whether they discuss the admission fees . So we looked at the data and in a lot of data people were saying things like  \" Can I get to this place ? \"", "Grad D: Oh .", "Grad C: \" What is the admission fee ? \" . So that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to Enter the place rather than uh to Tango or Vista ,", "Grad D: Uh - huh .", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad D: OK .", "Grad C: so .", "Grad D: I see .", "Grad B: There were  there 'd be other things besides just the admission fee , but  you know ,  we didn't have", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: That was like our example .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: That was the  initial one that we found .", "Grad D: OK . So there are certain cues that are very strong  either lexical or topic - based um , concept cues", "Grad B: From the discourse that  Yeah .", "Grad D: for one of those . And then in that second row  or whatever that row of Time of Day through that  So all of those  Some of them come from the utterance and some of them are sort of  either world knowledge or situational  things .", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad D: Right ? So that you have no distinction between those and OK .", "Grad B: One , uh  Uh .  Um , anything else you want to say Bhaskara ?", "Grad C: Um .", "Grad D: \" Unmark @ @ Time of Day \"", "Grad C: Yeah , I m I mean", "Grad A: Yeah . They 're  they 're are a couple of more things .", "Grad B: One thing  uh", "Grad A: I mean Uh . I would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we  we all uh , agree on what  what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe  what changes we", "Grad B: Yeah , th OK . so one thing I  I 'm you know unsure about , is how we have the discus uh  the \" admission fee \" thing set up . So one  thing that we were thinking was  by doing the layers like this , Uh  we kept um  things from directly affecting the mode  beyond the concept , but you could see perhaps discus the \" admission fee \" going directly to the mode pointing at \" Enter \" ,", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: right ? Versus pointing to just at \" tourist \" ,", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: OK ?", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: But we just decided to keep all the things we extracted  to point at the middle and then  down .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . Why is the landmark  OK . The landmark is facing to the tourists . That 's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not as possible um", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad B: Navigational landmarks ,", "Grad D: Navigational cue .", "Grad A: navigational landmarks", "Grad B: yeah .", "Grad A: so Mm - hmm . Then", "Grad B: Yeah , that would be  whatever building they referred to .", "Grad D: Prosody .", "Grad C: Right . So let 's see . The variables .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: Disc - \" admission fee \" is a binary thing , \" time of day \" is like morning , afternoon , night . Is that the deal ? Yeah .", "Grad B: That 's how we have it currently set up ,", "Grad A: Yep .", "Grad B: but it could be ,  you know , based upon hour", "Grad C: Yeah . Yeah .", "Grad A: Whatever granularity .", "Grad B: or  dis we could discrete it  des descret - ize it .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad A: Uh - huh .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: Yeah . Normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular  part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , I guess .", "Grad A: Yep .", "Grad D: OK . So that 's given in their input .", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad C: So  Right ,", "Grad D: Right ?", "Grad C: so it 's not really all of context . Similarly prosody is not all of prosody but simply  for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . that 's very nice , huh ?", "Grad D: OK .", "Grad A: The  the  So the context is a switch between tourist or non - tourist ?", "Grad C: and", "Grad A: Or also unknown ?", "Grad B: Or un  unknown ,", "Grad A: OK .", "Grad B: yeah .", "Grad C: Yeah . Unknown , right ?", "Grad D: So final dest So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist ,", "Grad C: Which is th Which one ?", "Grad D: but OK . so the the context being um , e I don't know if that question 's sort of in general , \" are you  \" I mean the  ar ar are do they allow business people to be doing non - business things at the moment ?", "Grad C: Yeah , it does .", "Grad D: OK . So then you just have some probabilities over", "Grad C: Everything is probablistic , and  There 's always", "Grad D: OK .  over which which of those it is .", "Grad C: Yeah . Um , right . So then landmark is  Oh , sorry . \" Verb used \" is like , right now we only have three values , but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: Rather , let me rephrase that . It  it can take values  in the set of all verbs , that they could possibly use .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: Um \" nice walls \" is binary , \" closed \" is binary \" final destination \" , again  Yeah , all those are binary I guess .

No .", "Grad C: Yeah , anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node .", "Grad A: Uh . It  Yeah . But all those things without question marks are also binary . Right ?", "Grad C: Which things ?", "Grad A: Nice walls ?", "Grad B: Wi", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: Oh . \" Nice walls \" is uh  something that we extract from our world knowledge .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: Yeah , a Oh yeah . Sorry . It is binary .", "Grad B: It is binary but it doesn't have question mark because it 's extracted .", "Grad C: That 's true . Yeah . OK , I see your point .", "Grad A: Yeah . OK .", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Grad A: I  I gotcha .", "Grad D: Uh - huh .", "Grad C: Yeah , similarly \" closed \" , I guess .", "Grad A: So we can either be in a hurry or not , but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment ?", "Grad C: Well , we To do that we would add another uh  value for that .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK .", "Grad C: And that would require s updating the probability distribution for \" mode \" as well .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: Because it would now have to like uh  take that possibility into account .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm . Take a conti", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: So um , of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases", "Grad A: Yeah , yeah .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad D: but you can imagine that it 's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would  that would help you  Like it 's a conjunction of , I don't know , you know , the verb used and some other stuff that  that would   determine", "Grad C: Right . Other syntactic information you mean ?", "Grad D: Yeah . Exactly .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad D: Um .", "Grad A: well the  the  sort of the landmark is  is sort of the object right ? the argument in a sense ?", "Grad D: Usually . I  I don't know if that 's always the case I  I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have . So . Um .", "Grad A: that 's always warping on something  some entity ,", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .

Go ahead .", "Grad B: OK . Dat - dat - dah . What should I observe ?", "Grad C: Just se set a few of them . You don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time .

But not transcontinentally .", "Grad B: I 'm frightened by Amtrak myself .", "Grad C: What ? Why ?", "Grad B: I just  They seem to have a lot of accidents on the Amtrak .", "Grad C: Really ?", "Grad A: Their reputation is very bad .", "Grad B: Yeah . Yeah .", "Grad A: huh ? It 's not maybe reality .", "Grad D: It 's not like German trains . Like German trains are really great so .", "Grad A: But  you know , I don't know whether it 's  which ones are safer , you know , statistically .", "Grad D: Um , but they 're faster .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad A: Much faster . Mm - hmm .", "Grad C: And there 's much more of them . Yeah , they 're Yeah , it 's  way better", "Grad A: yeah I used  um Amtrak quite a bit on the east coast and I was surprised . It was actually OK .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: You know , on Boston New York ,", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Grad A: New York Rhode Island ,", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad A: whatever ,", "Grad C: I 've done that kind of thing .", "Grad A: Boston .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: Yeah . But  That 's  a different issue .", "Grad B: This is going to be an interesting transcript .", "Grad A: Hmm ?", "Grad C: I  I want to see what it does with uh \" landmark - iness \" . That 's", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Grad D: Let 's all say it a few more times .", "Grad B: It 'd help it figure it out .", "Grad C: So .", "Grad D: Just kidding . Right .", "Grad C: Yeah .", "Grad D: So by the way tha that structure  that Robert drew on the board was like more um ,   cue - type - based , right , here 's like we 're gonna  segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse and then  some of the things we 're talking about here are more  you know , we mentioned maybe  if they talk about  um , I don't know , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based .", "Grad B: Hmm .", "Grad D: So I  I don't know if there  There 's obviously some  m more than one way of organizing  the variables into something", "Grad A: I think that um  What you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks , and maybe some of their conditions .", "Grad D: so . Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: One task is more likely you 're in a hurry when you do that kind of s doing business ,", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: and  and less in a hurry when uh  you 're a tourist Um   tourists may have  never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around so  maybe what  what  what happened  what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer ,", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: and then we 'll get these sub - middle layers , that are more cue - based .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm . That feed into those ?", "Grad A: Nah ?", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: Might be  might be a nice dichotomy of  of the world .

I mean but , they 're even like   I mean like , close to the end we were like , uh , you know we were like uh  really ad - hoc .", "Grad D: It 's a even distribution . Like , whatever .", "Grad C: Right ? Cuz if it 's like , uh  If it 's four things coming in , right ? And , say , some of them have like three possibilities and all that .

So .", "Grad B: Some of them are completely absurd too , like   they want to enter , but it 's closed ,", "Grad D: That 's uh   Well", "Grad B: it 's night time , you know there are tourists and all this weird stuff happens at the line up and you 're like", "Grad C: Yeah , the only like possible interpretation is that they are like  come here just to rob the museum or  something to that effect .", "Grad B: confused .", "Grad D: In which case you 're supposed to alert the authorities ,  and see appropriate action .", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Grad C: Yeah . Yeah , another thing to do , um , is also to , um  I guess to ask around people about other Bayes - net packages .

Mmm .", "Grad B: I haven't  J Jerry never sent out a  sent out an email , did he , ever ?", "Grad C: No . But he mentioned at the last meeting that someone was going to be talking , I forget who .", "Grad A: Oh , isn't Ben ?", "Grad C: Uh .", "Grad D: Ben ?", "Grad A: Ben , then ,", "Grad D: I think it 's Ben actually ,", "Grad A: Ben .", "Grad B: Ah !", "Grad D: yeah , um , giving his job talk I think . um , Sorry . I was just reading the screen .", "Grad A: OK .", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Grad C: Oh .", "Grad A: So the uh  That will be one  one thing we could do . I actually uh , have  Um , also we can uh , start looking at the SmartKom tables and I will", "Grad B: Right .", "Grad A: I actually wanted to show that  to you guys now but um .", "Grad B: Do you want to  trade ?", "Grad A: Um , no I  I actually made a mistake because it  it fell asleep and when Linux falls asleep on my machine it 's  it doesn't wake up ever , so I had to reboot", "Grad D: Oh , no .", "Grad A: And if I reboot without a network , I will not be able to start SmartKom , because I need to have a network .", "Grad B: Uh", "Grad A: So we 'll do that t maybe uh", "Grad C: But . OK . But once you start  sart start SmartKom you can be on  You don't have to be on a network anymore . Is that the deal ?", "Grad A: Yep .", "Grad C: Ah , interesting .", "Grad B: Why does SmartKom need a network ?", "Grad A: Um   it looks up some stuff that ,  you know , is  is that  is in the  written by the operating system only if it  if you get a DHCP request , so it  you know , my computer does not know its IP address , you know ?", "Grad B: Ah .", "Grad A: You know . So . Unless it boots up with networking .", "Grad B: It 's plugged in . Yeah .", "Grad A: And I don't have an IP address , they can't look up  they don't know who localhost is , and so forth and so forth .", "Grad D: Hmm .", "Grad A: Always fun . But it 's a , um , simple solution . We can just um , go downstairs and  and  and look at this , but maybe not today . The other thing um  I will  oh yeah , OK , I have to report  um , data collection . We interviewed Fey ,", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: She 's willing to do it , meaning be the wizard for the data collection , also  maybe transcribe a little bit , if she has to , but also recruiting subjects , organizing them , and so forth . So that looks good . Jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her , see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard .

Like are you", "Grad A: Um Liz also volunteered to be the first subject ,  which I think might be even better than us guys .", "Grad D: Good .", "Grad B: One of us , yeah .", "Grad A: If we do need her for the technical stuff , then of course one of you has to sort of uh  jump in .", "Grad B: I like how we 've  you guys have successfully narrowed it down . \" Is one of you going to be the subject ? \" Is one of you  jump in .", "Grad D: Reference . I haven't done it yet .", "Grad C: Well I just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good .", "Grad D: Oh plants ? e u someone who can plant difficult things .", "Grad C: Yeah . I mean that 's what we wanna  check , right ?", "Grad A: Um ,", "Grad D: Well , in this case it 's a p it 's a  sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject .", "Grad C: Isn't that what it is ?", "Grad D: It 's uh", "Grad A: yes w we  we would like to test the wizard , but  you know , if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get a more realistic", "Grad C: I guess that would be reasonable .", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Grad A: you know , set up as", "Grad B: Yeah . I know . That 's probably a good enough test of", "Grad D: Uh - huh .", "Grad A: Yeah .", "Grad C: Sort of having an actively antagonistic , uh", "Grad D: Yeah . That might be a little unfair . Um .", "Grad A: Yeah .", "Grad D: I 'm sure if we uh ,  You think there 's a chance we might need Liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? I 'm sure we can get  other people around who don't know anything  um , if we want another subject .", "Grad A: Yeah , yeah .", "Grad D: You know . Like I can drag Ben into it or something . Although he might cause problems but . So , is it a experimental setup for the um , data collection  totally  ready  determined ?", "Grad B: I like that . \" Test the wizard . \" I want that on a T - shirt .", "Grad A: Um  I think it 's  it 's  it 's  I mean  experimental setup u on the technical issue yes , except we st I think we still need uh  a recording device for the wizard , just a tape recorder that 's running in a room .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: But um  in terms of specifying the scenario ,  um  uh  uh  we 've gotten a little further", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: but um  we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard , and have the wizard partake in the  ultimate  sort of definition probe . So  so if  if on Friday it turns out that she really likes it and  and we really like her , then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and   getting all the details completely figured out .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: And um", "Grad D: OK . So the ideal task um ,  will have  whatever I don't know how much the structure of the evolving Bayes - net   will af affect  Like we wanna  we wanna be able to collect  as much of the variables that are needed for that ,", "Grad A: Mmm - yea - some .", "Grad D: right ? in the course of the task ? Well not all of them but you know .", "Grad A: Bu - e e e I 'm even  This  this Tango , Enter , Vista is sort of , itself , an ad - hoc scenario .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .

Just see what people say . And then maybe we 'll discover the phenomenon  the phenomena that we want to solve , you know , with  whatever engine we  we come up with . Um .

So in other words this data collection is  more general .", "Grad A: but since", "Grad D: It could  it could  be used for not just this task .", "Grad A: It should tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could occur , it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: and the sort of differences there . So it may get us some more information on the human - machine pragmatics , um , that no one knows anything about , as of yesterday . And uh   nothing has changed  since then , so . Uh . And secondly , now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this , and especially since um   Johno can't stop Tango - ing ,  we may actually include , you know , those  those intentions .
