I would say two", "Industrial Designer: Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so .", "Project Manager: . You agree ?", "User Interface: Yeah , I agree .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: It's better like that , isn't it ?", "Marketing: Now maybe the most critical one .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Most", "Marketing: L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ?", "Industrial Designer: Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking .", "User Interface: Yeah , it's very easy .", "Industrial Designer: You just need the command .", "User Interface: You can use this in this way .", "Marketing: Yeah but this this turning  can you can you just re explain me the", "Industrial Designer: As a principle .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Please .", "User Interface: Th this is the base .", "User Interface: So you can turn to change the channel .", "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?", "User Interface: You just tu turn d d", "Industrial Designer: I think maybe if you he", "Project Manager: Oh , ok I understand .", "Marketing: Like if you want to go from", "Project Manager: You take take  the remote , so", "Industrial Designer: If you hear some click", "Project Manager: and you can turn like that to change the channel ?", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah but imagine you y", "Project Manager: I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast .", "Marketing: Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to  if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?", "Industrial Designer: Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: How can you go directly to twenty , for example ?", "User Interface: No , no , no . I  if y uh if", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: it depend on the the angle you turn the", "Marketing: Yeah . I agree . I agree .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah but y how  you need to know  I", "Marketing: But I mean if you're fro from two ?", "User Interface: I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five .", "Industrial Designer: I think something that  Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah , you have a  , like that , and so on .", "User Interface: So change . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And you you can", "Marketing: Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh", "Project Manager: Oh yeah .", "User Interface: Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the  by three hundred thirteen degree .", "Marketing: We're not talking  Yeah .", "User Interface: So you got how many degree you you  it", "Project Manager: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go", "Industrial Designer: I think you can if you have a scale , so", "User Interface: No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: then the angle you stop is the angle you  is the channel you", "Marketing: Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?", "User Interface: It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the", "Marketing: So you you count  one degree , two degrees , no .", "User Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it .", "Marketing: I don't think so .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's a bit difficult .", "User Interface: I think so  I think so you can do it .  I think so , you can just change .", "Industrial Designer: I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so", "Marketing: Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main", "User Interface: There's uh also a number , you know .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's  you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel .", "Industrial Designer: Uh , yeah , and y that's  yeah .", "Project Manager: But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it .", "Marketing: And this would be more for browsing , ah .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . To see uh", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: yeah  uh", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Seems to be good .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Good choice , mister David Jordan .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , I mean you're famous . You  .", "Industrial Designer: And but I'd", "User Interface: And also you can , if you i", "Project Manager: yeah , what's what's this cherry ?", "User Interface: You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this .", "Industrial Designer: It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe .", "User Interface: For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this .", "User Interface: It's like fine , from coarse to fine .", "Marketing: Mm .", "User Interface: This is coarse , this is fine .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah yeah . That's", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: So it's coarse to fine design .", "Industrial Designer: that's very technologic , so .  Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah is is  this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel .", "Industrial Designer: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates", "User Interface: This is from one channel to", "Industrial Designer: maybe one of the", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah , th you have the vocal commands .", "Industrial Designer: Uh it's k", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: On off .", "Industrial Designer: on off , yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas", "Project Manager: Most of the time you have the  yeah it's a sleeping remote control .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , sleeping .", "Marketing: Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah .", "Project Manager: That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah .", "Industrial Designer: To compensate  .", "Marketing: Solar .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: So", "Marketing: So , which number ?", "Project Manager: three .", "Industrial Designer: Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three .", "Project Manager: Do you agree ?", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Three ?", "User Interface: Yeah , agree , agree .", "Marketing: So reasonably , is four , is one ?", "Industrial Designer: Three f three for me , it's o it's okay .", "Marketing: So , three .", "Industrial Designer: Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and  no and just take the mean .", "Project Manager: And what's your opinion ?", "Industrial Designer: Will you give four ?", "Marketing: Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me .", "Industrial Designer: Five ? Yeah , so maybe if", "User Interface: Uh w w what do y what uh  you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ?", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have  you just turn the turn the ball .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah but y you know", "User Interface: There's two kind of balls ,", "Marketing: So you have", "User Interface: the smaller the the the  so you can c you can c you can control the scale .", "Marketing: yeah .", "User Interface: But in the traditional controller , how do  how can you control the scale ?", "Marketing: Uh by pushing zero after after the first one .", "Industrial Designer: You just push two button , zero and and one .", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: And that's", "User Interface: yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Are there some buttons ?
