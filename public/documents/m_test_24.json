    "Project Manager: So let's start our second me meeting on  conceptual design .",
    "Project Manager: So ,",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: as the previous meeting I will be the secretary",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .",
    "Project Manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh",
    "Marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ?",
    "Project Manager: What ?",
    "Marketing: No ?",
    "Project Manager: I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Yep .",
    "Project Manager: So , we'll  S",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: technical accessoire ?",
    "User Interface: No no no .",
    "Project Manager: Interface ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: This .",
    "User Interface: Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: A nice one .",
    "User Interface: attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .",
    "Project Manager: I'm not sure the one in the middle  is very attractive .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , it's very , you know",
    "Project Manager: It's very big ,",
    "User Interface: if you're",
    "Project Manager: yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it .  Or to recognise it ,",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , why not .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .  Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: so .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "User Interface: So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "User Interface: so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we  I think we can attract a lot of user .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . Something else ?",
    "User Interface: Okay . No . There  this is the three concepts of our controller .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller ,  you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah , so",
    "Project Manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?",
    "User Interface: Y",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe .",
    "Project Manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?",
    "User Interface: Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , sure .",
    "User Interface: For example , if you cannot find your uh  controller , you can just uh  just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .",
    "Project Manager: I",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh yeah ,  that's a good  that's a good point , so .",
    "Project Manager: That's true .",
    "Industrial Designer: One and",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "User Interface: So you can use your gesture . That's no problem .",
    "Marketing: Yeah but how how is  how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?",
    "Project Manager: Broken arm ?",
    "User Interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very",
    "Marketing: Okay . Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching TV , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yep .",
    "Marketing: But this this  but this would never happen anyway .",
    "Project Manager: Why ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time .",
    "Project Manager: If you have one brother and one sister",
    "Marketing: Yeah",
    "Project Manager: and they want to watch their favourite uh TV programme ,",
    "Marketing: Yeah , but the",
    "Project Manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah but  Yeah",
    "User Interface: Yeah , it's very interesting .",
    "Marketing: Yeah but this",
    "Project Manager: so .",
    "Industrial Designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: because the",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ,",
    "Marketing: I don't think it",
    "Project Manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .",
    "Industrial Designer: That's right .",
    "Project Manager: You're not you're not obliged to share it .",
    "Marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , we can  yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can  I can say channel three ,",
    "Industrial Designer: It's  it's",
    "Marketing: No .",
    "User Interface: so it's c come to channel three ,",
    "Marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .",
    "User Interface: I don't have to",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .",
    "User Interface: It's advantage .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but one other question .",
    "Industrial Designer: manual controllers , eh .",
    "Project Manager: How how much will it cost ?",
    "Industrial Designer: No , more expensive maybe .",
    "User Interface: How much ?",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .",
    "User Interface: No no we we d we we just are use um",
    "Project Manager: Some some efficient .",
    "Marketing: Uh if you if if you use the basic",
    "User Interface: No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .",
    "Project Manager: So you think it won't cost an  Not a lot for us ? Or ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah , I think it's uh  because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but uh uh",
    "User Interface: it's uh  yeah . It's",
    "Marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . Because then you need uh  I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .",
    "Industrial Designer: Well y y you have also the language problem ,",
    "User Interface: No it's uh  Even for the f um because the the vocabulary  the",
    "Industrial Designer: you know when you",
    "Project Manager: Mm-mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: 'Cause it it have to be universal ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah . I agree with uh",
    "Industrial Designer: so .",
    "User Interface: The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're  we want to sell it in France .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: so .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our  the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation",
    "Marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah but you know . The product  The pro",
    "User Interface: mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .",
    "Industrial Designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe",
    "Project Manager: Mm , okay .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah ,",
    "Project Manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?",
    "User Interface: it's",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . But",
    "User Interface: Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but how will you",
    "User Interface: So",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "User Interface: Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but for each country you have to do one ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: because uh the for example for Se",
    "User Interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh really ?  That's",
    "Project Manager: Oh .",
    "Marketing: Yeah ,",
    "Project Manager: Seems to be quite complex .",
    "Marketing: but then w Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Comple",
    "User Interface: No , it's not so complex  .",
    "Marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros",
    "Project Manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?",
    "Marketing: problem .",
    "Project Manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?",
    "User Interface: No no no it's not  I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just  the microphone is embedded in the controller .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but where is the controller ?",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Where is the controller ?",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: It's in your family , in your home .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but we're",
    "Marketing: No , but then it's it's like this uh",
    "Project Manager: here it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .",
    "Industrial Designer: A microphone maybe .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .",
    "Industrial Designer: To talk to the to the TV maybe .",
    "Project Manager: You just want to interact with television .",
    "User Interface: Yeah yeah just  you just put the controller here , then you",
    "Industrial Designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel ,",
    "User Interface: you use your command",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: yeah .",
    "User Interface: and you do s your gesture .",
    "Project Manager: but you can lose it .",
    "User Interface: No no it's n y   if you lose it",
    "Industrial Designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the TV to switch to channel one .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay you  so you can build a kind of black box",
    "Industrial Designer: Devic",
    "Project Manager: and put it on TV and just to recognize gestures and voice .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone  inside your remote control .",
    "Project Manager: Ah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: But you would still have the buttons . Or is it  do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?",
    "User Interface: think it  we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think",
    "Marketing: Okay , so you",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ,",
    "User Interface: yeah .",
    "Marketing: yeah .",
    "User Interface: You can see  they can switch form one modality to another .",
    "Project Manager: Mm .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky .",
    "Project Manager: I think so .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: No ,",
    "Project Manager: And maybe it will be quite",
    "User Interface: that's quite inter quite attractive .",
    "Industrial Designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so  although y y",
    "User Interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem .",
    "Marketing: Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah but i i",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: I dunno .",
    "User Interface: We should have confidence in technology .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , we should .  Uh .",
    "Project Manager: Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm .",
    "Marketing: What ?",
    "Project Manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?",
    "Marketing: If if  I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .",
    "User Interface: More features , yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but",
    "Marketing: But if if if it like doubles uh",
    "Industrial Designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable ,",
    "Marketing: no one would would be interested .",
    "Industrial Designer: so .",
    "Project Manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Just want to have something  controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ?",
    "User Interface: Yeah but if if you stick to um  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah . No ,",
    "User Interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that",
    "Marketing: I mean",
    "Industrial Designer: It's not really the  we",
    "Marketing: Y",
    "Industrial Designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so  or something like that . But uh I think a user need",
    "User Interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of TV . You can replace your TV with a new TV with internet browsing function ,",
    "Marketing: No ,",
    "User Interface: but",
    "Marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Don't have a  the the  Yeah",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Marketing: or",
    "Industrial Designer: if we can send email from it .",
    "User Interface: But it's not the  only the problem  only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the TV .",
    "Marketing: No . No .",
    "Industrial Designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if",
    "Marketing: Cause for example  yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller ,",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but uh we want so",
    "User Interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , you wou you would",
    "User Interface: That's",
    "Marketing: True .",
    "User Interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our  from other products .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: And for all the person of the family maybe ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah , uh",
    "Project Manager: You don't need to tune it .",
    "Industrial Designer: so , yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's",
    "Marketing: I mean , for example the goo y",
    "Industrial Designer: Because you have new",
    "Marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .",
    "Marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . Google is  is simple , works fine ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .",
    "Marketing: Uh thi this  I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition",
    "User Interface: The  then nn",
    "Marketing: or",
    "User Interface: no .",
    "Marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really  fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .",
    "User Interface: Tha",
    "Project Manager: Not too expensive too .",
    "User Interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .",
    "Marketing: See",
    "User Interface: That's the same",
    "Marketing: That's the problem ,",
    "User Interface: yeah .",
    "Marketing: yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .",
    "Industrial Designer: Ye",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: and so .",
    "Project Manager: Okay . So",
    "Marketing: I mean , that's the point .",
    "Project Manager: let's go to the Industrial Designer .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Two ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , participant two um",
    "Project Manager: Working ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , working design ,",
    "Industrial Designer: so .",
    "Industrial Designer: So I think",
    "Project Manager: I can",
    "Industrial Designer: Can you go to the  next one ? I uh  it's not this one .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: It's uh oth the oth  so I",
    "Industrial Designer: It's the working design . Sorry .  Component design .",
    "Project Manager: It's okay",
    "Industrial Designer: So this yeah  so this is the described use",
    "Industrial Designer: What ? Are you inst",
    "Project Manager: Uh I think there's something wrong with your",
    "User Interface: It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it .",
    "Project Manager: Maybe you you record it somewhere else .",
    "Industrial Designer: I don't think so .",
    "User Interface: Participant one . Participant one .",
    "Project Manager: Interface concept . No .",
    "Marketing: Hmm .",
    "Project Manager: Mm mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Oh . Maybe I record recorded directly on the  Computer .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Uh .  Nope .",
    "Marketing: Dunno .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay , okay . Yes .",
    "Project Manager: It seems that we have a problem with the",
    "Marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or",
    "Industrial Designer: I can say it to you without .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , so",
    "User Interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to",
    "Project Manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh",
    "User Interface: uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides ,",
    "Marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,",
    "User Interface: then present it later .",
    "Marketing: okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: exac",
    "Project Manager: You will had s some more information in",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , true .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: In fact , I don't know ,",
    "Project Manager: So . Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with",
    "Project Manager: Okay , never mind .",
    "Industrial Designer: so  It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside",
    "User Interface: Okay . Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: and  so . So I  in fact the the  f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: so will  it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and  in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like LCD where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation",
    "User Interface: Uh-huh .",
    "Industrial Designer: or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: and  so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm .",
    "Project Manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers",
    "Industrial Designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .",
    "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,",
    "Project Manager: no ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will  if we want to have battery , regular battery and and  the solar energy battery it could be  it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,",
    "Project Manager: So .",
    "Industrial Designer: but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: so hmm .",
    "Project Manager: And what tha what about the uh materials ?",
    "Industrial Designer: And the materials , it depends for example you  if you have a wooden material it can be more  the plastic material is more common",
    "Project Manager: Impersonal , mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Special for",
    "Industrial Designer: or you know , you can have some",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , and i if you  we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: and it can be interesting .",
    "Project Manager: Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and  so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: And you think that we will be",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Industrial Designer: so .",
    "Project Manager: So wood .",
    "Project Manager: And what about the buttons ?",
    "Industrial Designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the LCD you know  lighted buttons because , you know , it's  I don't know  um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion",
    "Project Manager: No it's fashion , yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch TV in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .",
    "Marketing: What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .",
    "Industrial Designer: I think a touch screen  will be t as expensive as the LCD buttons so .",
    "Marketing: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: But  And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: So you got email ?",
    "Project Manager: I dunno .  I think we have only   uh five minutes left .",
    "Marketing: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: Participant four ? Functional requirements ?",
    "Marketing: Uh no , trend watching .  The other one .",
    "Project Manager: This one ?",
    "Marketing: Yeah . Uh , I think so , just  Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .",
    "Marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  I mean  i i it sounds good technically",
    "User Interface: Mm .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm .",
    "Marketing: but it's it's not what they want and uh  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .",
    "Project Manager: Okay .",
    "Marketing: At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .",
    "Marketing: Now i if we look at fashion in general um  Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Ah yes .",
    "Marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah .",
    "Marketing: 'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris",
    "Industrial Designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah .",
    "Marketing: we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Spongy  'Kay .",
    "Marketing: okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah , yeah .",
    "Marketing: I dunno .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?",
    "Marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like um",
    "Industrial Designer: Pla S",
    "Marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh",
    "Industrial Designer: Very stuff  Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .",
    "Marketing: device , so um",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So ,  as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and  with battery would be something interesting ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Solar .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , so when I think it's",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: maybe will attract",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: Mm-hmm",
    "Industrial Designer: It will be a",
    "Project Manager: pro-ecology consumers .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think   Yeah , yeah . Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Case .",
    "User Interface: Later ?",
    "Project Manager: So you think  case . Something spongy .  Someth no wood .",
    "Industrial Designer: No wood but  Plastic ?",
    "Marketing: Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know .",
    "Industrial Designer: Would some",
    "User Interface: Pla",
    "Project Manager: Maybe you",
    "Industrial Designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . It depends on the design we want ,",
    "Marketing: Yeah , maybe the base .",
    "Industrial Designer: so .",
    "Project Manager: It's it's natural .",
    "Marketing: But still y",
    "Project Manager: Th The feeling is natural ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's natural",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: and i",
    "Project Manager: so maybe we can stay with wood .",
    "Industrial Designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol",
    "Marketing: Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm , yeah , it's not right , so .",
    "Project Manager: But it's still fashion .",
    "Marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Marketing: or",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ,",
    "Marketing: I dunno .",
    "Project Manager: something that you can  into it .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Uh and what about the user interface concept ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Google and",
    "Project Manager: Google and fancy ?",
    "Industrial Designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ?  And",
    "Project Manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .",
    "Industrial Designer: Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested",
    "User Interface: Uh yes .",
    "Industrial Designer: and how   It It is an an interesting concept to see  to have uh voice control .",
    "Marketing: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .",
    "User Interface: The smart controller .",
    "Industrial Designer: But  and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the TV , so speak directly to the TV and you don't need a remote control actually ,",
    "Project Manager: Yeah ,",
    "Industrial Designer: so .",
    "Project Manager: but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .",
    "Industrial Designer: But it will be embedded on the TV and not on the remote control , so .",
    "Project Manager: That's true .",
    "Marketing: Yeah  d",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,",
    "Marketing: I dunno .",
    "User Interface: Mm .",
    "Project Manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .",
    "User Interface: Yeah . It's good .",
    "Project Manager: And LCD buttons .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , LCD .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to",
    "Marketing: What interface ?",
    "Project Manager: Yeah , for the interface something  added value .",
    "Industrial Designer: I think the supplement can be the voice  . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of",
    "Project Manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .",
    "Project Manager: commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Mm .",
    "User Interface: Mm-hmm .",
    "Industrial Designer: To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four .",
    "Project Manager: Turning the TV o on o or off .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , turning   yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands ,",
    "Project Manager: So ,",
    "Industrial Designer: so .",
    "Project Manager: adding some vocal commands .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Simple ones ?",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah , simple ones for",
    "Project Manager: Okay .  So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes  so  we'll  you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "User Interface: Yep . Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons",
    "Industrial Designer: expensive buttons   Yeah , to make some new",
    "Project Manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .",
    "Industrial Designer: Yeah .",
    "Project Manager: And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .",
    "Marketing: Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay , fruits .",
    "Project Manager: Yeah .",
    "Marketing: If possible .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really  it will be seen in the remote control .",
    "Industrial Designer: Need it to be , okay .",
    "Project Manager: So you will have  Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control ,",
    "User Interface: Yeah .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: so you will have to model model something .",
    "User Interface: Okay . Yep",
    "Project Manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .",
    "Industrial Designer: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: So ,",
    "User Interface: Okay .",
    "Project Manager: no more questions , we can close the session .",
    "Industrial Designer: Sounds good , mm-hmm .",
